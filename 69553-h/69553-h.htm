<p class='c018'><i>Conrad, Abbot of Cloister-Curwald, to
Elizabeth, the Widowed Countess of
Torrenburg<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</i></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The real name is <i>Toggenburg</i>; but as this
would have sounded harsh in English ears, I have
taken the liberty of softening it a little; and in
several parts of this work I have changed the
names of places and personages entirely.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Your resolution, noble Elizabeth,
to remain in cloistered solitude, passing
your hours in tears for your husband’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>loss, and in prayers for the repose of his
spirit, is dignified and worthy of the
illustrious race to which you have the
glory to belong. Model of female constancy!
though years have elapsed since
Frederick died, your tears flow as freely
as on the first day of your widowhood!
Unequalled lady! does there exist a virtue,
whose seeds we ought not to depend
on finding in a heart like yours?
Is there a sacrifice so great that a soul
like Elizabeth’s is incapable of making
it?—In the bloom of life to tear yourself
from the pleasures of the world and
the eyes of a thousand admirers, that
you may watch away the lonely nights
by the sepulchral urn of an husband far
advanced in years; to fly from the
charms of sway and grandeur that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>may humble yourself before the altar,
kneeling in the dust, and praying for
the repose of the deceased-one, oh!
what an act of self-denial! an act, which
reaches the summit of magnanimity, by
not being established on the foundation of
love; for in truth, how could love for
the decrepit Frederick find a place in the
heart of the young and blooming Elizabeth,
whose warmest sentiment must
have been filial respect towards a benefactor?</p>

<p class='c021'>Oh! Elizabeth, is indeed your state
of widowhood your only motive for
taking refuge in a convent?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>An expression used in the conclusion
of your letter fully explains the sentiment
which I felt, and still feel for the
Count of Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yes, Conrad; Frederick was my
<i>benefactor</i> in the strongest sense of the
word—and therefore is it, that though
years have elapsed since his decease, my
tears for his loss still flow as freely as
they did on the first day. But whether
sorrow for my widowed state was my
only motive for burying myself in a
cloister.... Oh! Conrad, it was unnecessary
for you to use flattery in order
to obtain a knowledge of the truth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Without calling me “the model of
female constancy,” or declaring me to be
without an equal, I might have been Induced
to confess, that Frederick’s death
was <i>not</i> the only reason which at
first induced me to take refuge in
a convent, and which perhaps will
induce me never to leave it more.
Oh! much, very much lies heavy
upon this heart of mine! I suffer
under the pressure of misfortunes, of
which but a small part is known to you;
yet even that little must be sufficient to
make you comprehend, why I feel
compelled to abandon the world, and
fly to solitude for relief and comfort.
Conrad! Conrad! would to Heaven it
were <i>true</i>, that there is no sacrifice so
great, that I am incapable of making it!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Alas! I feel but too strongly, that great
sacrifices are in my power, for which I
must prepare myself by supplication to
Heaven, and the solitude and calm of a
cloister.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Conrad to Elizabeth.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>I know not to what sacrifices you
allude in saying, there exist some
which are too great for you to make.
Worldly possessions, I am certain, are
without value in your eyes: should then
hereafter generosity or a sense of justice
require of you some trifling renunciation
in this respect, could it possibly cost
you much pain, or would you long deliberate
what course you should adopt?
In order to be rich and powerful, Elizabeth
needed not to become the heiress
of Torrenburg. Independent of her
husband’s attachment, fortune had already
rendered her mistress of sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>wealth to make it easy for her to afford
posterity an admirable example of self-denial.
She who can dispose of castles
and villages<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> without receiving on the
one hand any return but ingratitude,
and on the other but hatred and rebellion,
may surely bring herself in the
course of time to restore those possessions
(to which the prepossession of her
fascinated husband could in <i>fact</i> give her
no right) to the forsaken innocent orphans,
whose claims have so undeservedly
been set aside. How glorious a recompense
<i>hereafter</i> would she earn by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>such an act! What gratitude, what
tranquillity of soul would she obtain at
<i>present</i>! what rapturous admiration
would she be viewed with even by the
latest posterity! How shining and
how distinguished would be the place
allotted to her among the illustrious ladies,
who derive their blood from the
Counts of Carlsheim and Sargans.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Elizabeth of March (who inherited from
her husband the valuable county of Torrenburg
and other extensive possessions to the exclusion
of his natural heirs) bestowed considerable districts
of her territory on the people of Zurich,
which excited great discontent among her vassals.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Conrad, what am I to think of you?—you
almost adopted in your first letters
to me the tone of adoration; I was
a “model of female constancy;” I was
“an unequalled woman.” In your
last, the secret seems to have escaped
you, “that nothing but the prepossession
of a fascinated husband could have made
me what I am.”</p>

<p class='c021'>I guess your views: you hope to
draw from me some decision favorable
to the claims of the Damsels of Werdenberg;
but in truth I am not arrived at
such high excellence in the science of
self-denial. It is easy, my good Abbot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to give away half our property out of
pure <i>generosity</i>, even though we meet in
return with nothing but ingratitude;
but it is hard, very hard to bestow that
same half on those who think they have
a <i>title</i> to it, even though all the universe
should admire and praise us for ... having
done our <i>duty</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>My brother Oswald, who has arrived
here within these few days, salutes
you, and recommends himself to your
prayers.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Conrad to Elizabeth.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>I was certain, before I read the conclusion
of your letter, that Count Oswald
was not far from you: uninfluenced,
never could Elizabeth have suffered
her hand to trace such words!
Go then, ye innocent victims of slander,
even from the generous Elizabeth have
ye nothing to hope! she terms you
“the Damsels of Werdenberg,” without
recollecting that <i>another</i> name would
have belonged to you, had not fortune
robbed you of it in order to confer it
upon <i>her</i>. Go then, go, thou gentle
Constantia; go too, afflicted and much
belied Ida; increase the number of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>unfortunate ladies of Sargans, and live
upon the bounty of the vassals of your
forefathers: the heiress of Torrenburg
has nothing to bestow upon you, not
even unavailing pity; of justice I will
not speak. Under what climate of
Heaven you now exist, Elizabeth knows
not, asks not, cares not!</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>I have long remarked one fault in
you, my good Abbot; you generally
press your point too eagerly, and thus
ruin the cause which you support, with
those whose natural inclinations would
have disposed them otherwise to do
what you require. Not that this is the
case with <i>me</i>; to convince you of which,
I now entreat you for the present, and
<i>only</i> for the present, to be silent on a
subject which (from causes as yet unknown
to you) pains my heart most
cruelly. I am not ignorant of Constantia’s
abode; as to Ida ... yet why should
I concern myself about the Damsels of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Werdenberg? If (as you assert) I have
robbed them of a name which but for
me would have belonged to them, <i>they</i>
perhaps have deprived me of <i>another</i>,
which was more precious to me than
my life; a name, which was the long-wished-for
goal of all my fondest hopes;
a name, for which I would have exchanged
the high-sounding title of
“heiress of Torrenburg,” God knows
how willingly!</p>

<p class='c021'>Suffer me to chuse another subject—you
seem to be well acquainted with the
annals of the family with which I am
become connected by marriage; it is
certain at least, that neither in your conversations
or letters have I ever heard
you mention the knights and ladies of
the houses of Carlsheim and Sargans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>without applying to them some striking
epithet. Even in your very last epistles,
“the unfortunate ladies,”—“the illustrious
ladies of Sargans,”—were mentioned.
Who were these remarkable personages,
and what were their misfortunes?
If it lies in your power to give me any
account of them, you will oblige me by
making them the subject of your future
letters. Otherwise I am necessitated to
request a temporary interruption of our
correspondence, as I am not desirous of
reading more upon the subject which of
late has employed your pen.</p>

<p class='c023'>The annals of the ladies of Sargans
are in the possession of the Abbess of
Zurich, whose convent you at present
inhabit. I can myself do no more than
furnish you with a short supplement to
this family history, and which I will
readily transmit to you, whenever you
think proper to renew a correspondence,
which ceases for the present with this
letter.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Count Oswald of March.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>I have offended our good old Conrad:
the correspondence which I have kept
up for so many years with the faithful
instructor of my childhood is at length
laid aside; and many a vacant hour as
this instructive intercourse has beguiled,
I yet must confess, I am not sorry that
it has ceased for the present. Conrad
latterly began to press me too hard upon
a subject, on which (in compliance, dear
brother, with your advice) I am determined
not to come to any hasty determination.
Ah! the point would have
been determined long ago, had I not
been compelled to hesitate by your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>friendly representations and the weakness
of my own heart!</p>

<p class='c021'>And yet, dear Oswald, to confess
the truth, the latter had more influence
with me than the former. Paint to me
in as brilliant colours as you chuse the
advantage of being sovereign lady of
such an extensive territory; ah! can
the empty pride of governing a turbulent
ungrateful people restore to me the
ruined tranquillity of my heart? My
wealth and power were even beyond
my wishes, unaided by the liberal bequest
of my dear, my partial husband;
and long ago should Constantia have
enjoyed those rights to which (so at
least they say) her claim is undoubted,
were it not that Ida must necessarily
have shared in the good-fortune of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>sister; Ida, who stole from me the heart
of Montfort! Ida, who trampled on
the fondest wishes of my soul! No! that
thought is not to be endured! The wanton
arts of that perfidious girl forced me
from the bosom of my Henry into the
aged arms of the Count of Torrenburg:
now then let her enjoy the fruits of her
good deed! Gratitude taught me to
love Frederick, and to forget Henry;
but to reward these traitors for having
so successfully betrayed me; to enrich
them with all that has been bestowed on
me by the last will of the excellent possessor
... this is a pitch of heroic virtue,
of which I can be capable but in a very
few moments of romantic enthusiasm.
In one of those moments, <i>you</i>, dear
Oswald, came to my assistance, rouzed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>me from my dream of heroism, dissipated
the vapours which bewildered my
senses, and now you may rest secure
that I shall make no rash resolutions.</p>

<p class='c021'>I confess, the Abbot helped to give
your advice effect, by preaching to me
such endless sermons about <i>justice</i>. What
then, my good Conrad? the conferring
happiness on those perfidious hypocrites
by whom my confidence has been so
cruelly abused, this sacrifice which but
to think upon makes all my long-inflicted
wounds bleed afresh, all this would
be nothing more than an every-day
performance of a positive duty? Is
this the way to estimate one of the
most difficult tasks of self-victory
that ever was prescribed to the heart
of a woman?</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Agitated as are my present feelings, I
dare not trust myself to be much alone.
I seek every where for subjects of amusement,
but find every where ennui.
You, my kind friend, are at a distance,
and my epistolary communication with
Conrad, to which I have been so long
accustomed, has for the present ceased
entirely. Yet the good Abbot, to whom
I am already under such obligations, is
also in <i>this</i> instance the cause of my
looking forward to some future means
of rescuing myself from this state of
tedious indolence.</p>

<p class='c021'>In hopes of leading him away from
a topic, which I am at present unwilling
to discuss, I reminded him of the
antient histories of the Counts of Carlsheim
and Sargans; and I requested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>him to make them the subject of his
future correspondence—you know, the
old man is generally delighted to find an
opportunity of talking over such matters;
but just now he is too much offended
with me, and too much occupied
with a different business, to permit himself
to be lured away from his point by
this little artifice. He has coldly referred
me for information to the Abbess of
Zurich; and the want of other amusement
has actually induced me to apply
to her on this subject, which, when I
first took it up, was merely a pretence
for relieving myself from the pressure of
Conrad’s too urgent solicitations.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Abbess as yet has only given me
distant hopes that my curiosity shall be
indulged; but by dint of repeated petitions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>I trust I shall persuade her to
communicate to me these “important
and remarkable writings,” as the Abbess
calls them. Should I succeed, I shall
not fail, oh! most learned of all knights
of the present day! to lay whatever
seems worthy of attention before your
philosophical eyes.</p>

  <h3 class='c022'><i>Sigisbert, Bishop of Coira, to the Abbot Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Without attempting further to
influence her conduct, let Elizabeth
be permitted to act according to her
own pleasure: I know her motives;
I know that in the end we shall have
reason to be satisfied with her. I am
informed also, that she has already
taken some such steps towards settling
this important business as will bear but
one interpretation. Letters have been
received from her by our friend the
Seneschal, a man whose superior for probity
is not to be found in Zurich; in
these letters Elizabeth explains the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>whole transaction, requests him to act as
an impartial judge, and engages to obey
his decision blindly. You know well the
venerable Albert Reding, to whose
justice the whole country refers every
dispute of consequence; think you, he
will decide to the disadvantage of innocence?
Not that I have obtained my
knowledge of these secret particulars
from Albert himself, the delicacy of whose
opinions on this species of confidence is
extreme. In truth, he carries that delicacy
so far, that he anxiously avoids
mentioning the disputes between the
Countess and her vassals, and endeavours,
when others speak of them, to
listen with a cold indifferent air: but I
read plainly on his serious brow that he
meditates deeply on the subject; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>weighs the bequest of Count Frederick,
and the situation of the unfortunate sisters,
and I can prophecy to which side
the balance will incline. He, who never
yet gave an unfair judgment; he, who
has never deserved to have an appeal
made from his decision, cannot surely
pronounce erroneously upon a business
like this.</p>

<p class='c021'>Your intention of laying before Elizabeth’s
eyes the whole history of the rejected
heiresses of Torrenburg is well
imagined, and may produce a good
effect: but what shall I say to you respecting
your imprudence, in advising
her to inspect the private annals of the
house of Sargans? My good but inconsiderate
friend, are you then ignorant
of the part which your Abbey plays in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>these memorials of the days of yore? Is
it adviseable, think you, to lay before
the laity the transgressions of the church?
Let us rejoice, that we walk ourselves in
the paths of virtue, without endeavouring
to make our own merits appear more
shining, by contrasting them with the
crimes of our predecessors.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet I know well, that so mean a
design was far from the thoughts of
my good Conrad; he has only erred
through want of consideration. I shall
immediately endeavour, if possible, to
repair your fault; already must letters
from me have reached the Abbess of
Zurich, and I hope that Elizabeth will
not be suffered to peruse a single line of
the papers.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is but a short time since these curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Memoirs were in my possession; and I
can assure you (if, as I take for granted,
you are not already conscious of it) they
contain many circumstances, which for
the honour of the Abbey of Curwald,
and (with grief I write it) for that of
some of my own ancestors, had better
remain for ever unknown.</p>

  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Count Oswald</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In vain do I strive to turn my
thoughts from Montfort; the reflection
“what is to become of him” occupies
my mind incessantly. Alas! there
was a time, when I loved him with
such passion! when there was nothing
which I would not have given to purchase
for him one moment’s happiness!
and <i>now</i>, oh! what a change! <i>she</i>,
who once was ready to sacrifice for this
Montfort every thing, even the affection
of a warning brother, who saw deeper
into the deceiver’s heart than herself; <i>she</i>
now hesitates, by giving up a few superfluous
miles of territory and some high-sounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>empty titles, to rescue him from
the very abyss of misery and ruin!—and
all this change in her heart is produced
by the sole reflection, that Montfort’s
prosperity would now be shared
no longer with herself. Oh! Elizabeth!
Elizabeth! thou hast a groveling soul!
thy passion for Henry, so falsely called
heroic, was nothing better than mere
self-love!</p>

<p class='c021'>Chide me not, dear brother, for this
want of resolution; I am conscious the
expression of such feelings must be little
expected by you after the temper of
mind, in which you saw me when we
parted: but you know not the dreadful
contest between affection and duty,
which has but lately been excited in my
bosom—what! Henry imprisoned by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>his uncle, as a punishment for having
bestowed his heart on the portionless
Ida? Henry, commanded by the incensed
Count de Montfort to purchase
liberty by offering me his hand? What
then, do I live to see my nuptial bed
made the alternative of a dungeon?
Oswald! Oswald! oh! what a humiliation
for the proud Elizabeth, let what
is required of him be refused or accepted
by Henry!—as for myself, my resolution
is fixed; but yet, through respect
for you and your counsels, it has
not been fixed till after mature deliberation.
I will not have the appearance of
acting either from an impulse of extravagant
generosity, or from that spirit
of refined vengeance, which induces us
to crush our enemies under the load of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>obligations: no; I will do nothing but
my <i>duty</i>. I have submitted the whole
affair to the decision of an impartial
judge: I will ascertain how
much I <i>ought</i> to do for the Damsels of
Werdenberg, and exactly that much
will I do, without desiring to be thanked
by any one. What would be my feelings,
Oswald.... Heaven and Earth! what
would be my feelings, were I to hear
Montfort thank me for having <i>kindly</i>
facilitated his union with his beloved
Ida!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Oswald.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>My brother, we will in future chuse
other subjects for discussion: Montfort
and Ida ought now to hold a
place no longer in my private thoughts,
nor shall their names be ever again traced
by my pen. To banish these spectres
which haunt my mind so fearfully, and
bury them for ever in oblivion, or at
least only to remember them with contempt,
surely I need but to recall that
memorable day, when my dear exasperated
brother forgave the lovesick-girl’s
elopement, her elopement with this deceitful
Montfort; when he promised still
to acknowledge her as his sister, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>condescended to make known to the
traitor with his own lips, that Count Oswald
would not disdain to honour and
esteem him as his sister’s husband—and
then let me remember, how Henry led
the proud Elizabeth in triumph to the
altar; and how at the very moment that
he prepared to swear to her eternal constancy,
the irrevocable word refused to
pass his lips, because ... because among
her attendants he discovered a face,
whose features seemed to him more
lovely than his bride’s.</p>

<p class='c021'>Oh! when I recollect these circumstances,
my brother! the Damsels of
Werdenberg, the chosen friends of my
bosom, were invited to place the nuptial
garland on my brow, and the false-ones
tore it in pieces, and trampled it under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>their feet. With what a look of horror
and aversion did Henry throw away my
hand! He affected to be suddenly indisposed
too! oh! ’twas a mere pretence!
his midnight flight from the Castle, and
his consternation at hearing, that those
perfidious girls were gone, ought to
have left me no doubt upon the subject;
yet I suspected nothing till the cruel
news arrived, that Ida’s fate was as
closely connected with Henry’s, as I once
had flattered myself to have seen my
own.</p>

<p class='c021'>Again I repeat it, I will discuss this
subject no longer. My prayers had
once the power of soothing Oswald’s
vengeance and saving the offender’s life;
shall my lamentations excite afresh
that sleeping vengeance?—No! I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>be silent!—I thank you, dear Oswald,
for all your kindness; still love Elizabeth,
but strive not to avenge her.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Oswald.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>I doubt whether I act wisely in writing
to you so often? a less interesting
occupation would conduce more to the
tranquillity of my bosom, and such an
occupation am I earnestly endeavouring
to procure. A visit to the Abbess, for
the purpose of renewing my entreaties
respecting the annals of Sargans, has
exalted my curiosity to the very highest
pitch. I am sensible, that anxiety to
learn the sufferings of those who have
been as unfortunate as myself, alleviates
the weight of my own afflictions.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Abbess appeared to be undecided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>whether she should indulge me with a
sight of these writings, which she had
already been drawn into an half promise
to communicate.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“My dear lady,” said she smiling,
“had you not rather obtain a personal
knowledge of those ladies, who are treated
of in these moth-eaten ill-written
leaves, and whose adventures, or at
least as much of them as deserves your
attention, I can myself relate to you
concisely?—Look!” she continued, at
the same time removing a silken curtain
which extended itself over the whole
western side of her closet; “look! here
are the portraits of the most remarkable
among those celebrated ladies, respecting
whose lives some idle person has
contrived to make you so inquisitive. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>confess, I <i>do</i> possess the writings in
question; but believe me, daughter,
they are buried under such a heap of uninteresting
papers relating to different
matters, that to explore them would be
too tedious a task for the leisure of an
anchoret or the patience of a saint.”</p>

<p class='c021'>I stood silent, and listened, and looked;
but in truth the speaking portraits
of these females, the most lovely and excellent
of their day, and the interesting
fragments of their annals which escaped
from the Abbess of Zurich as she pointed
them out to me by name, were by no
means likely to cure me of my inclination
to know more of their adventures.</p>

<p class='c021'>You are not the only one of the family,
Oswald, who possesses the talent of
persuasion; your sister too inherits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>some little portion of that for which her
brother is so remarkable. I conquered;
and before evening arrived, I had the
satisfaction to see brought into my
chamber a large iron chest, which contained
materials of sufficient interest to
steal me from my own sorrows, and
transport me into a different world from
that in which I am existing—oh! how
delightful is it for a wounded heart
thus to steal itself away from the theatre
of its afflictions!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h3 class='c022'><i>Elizabeth to Oswald.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The morning broke, and found me
still occupied in examining the moth-eaten
parchments; selecting those which
appeared to be the most interesting, and
separating them from the rest, which I
purposed to reserve for a future opportunity.
It was fortunate, that I did
not delay this examination till the next
day. Scarcely were the nuns returned
from matins, when my treasure was
redemanded of me. <i>The</i> Abbess came to
make excuses in person. She talked of
secrets regarding the Convent, and the
commands of the Bishop of Coira,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>though, as far as I can make out, the
<i>great lady</i> (for such is the appellation
which the nuns give the Domina of Zurich)
is totally independent of him. She
might as well have spared her apologies;
I was angry, and scarcely could prevail
on myself to answer her with common
politeness. She had broken her word
with me; and therefore I feel but little
compunction for having over-reached
her, and kept back several of the writings,
which I had previously laid aside.
They happen to be exactly those (at least
I hope so) which the sight of those portraits
in the Domina’s closet had made
me most anxious to examine.</p>

<p class='c021'>One parcel consists of the Memoirs
of Urania Venosta; she is pale, and a
black veil half conceals her features, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the grief which is exprest in her countenance
(the picture represents her in
the decline of life) has still left her
charms sufficient to make us guess, how
perfect must have been her beauty while
yet in the full bloom of youth.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another packet contains some account
of the unfortunate Adelaide, lady
of the Beacon-Tower; she was a daughter
of the house of Carlsheim, and had resolution
enough to attend upon her unfortunate
husband till his last breath, which
he was doomed to breathe out upon the
scaffold! Adelaide only left the place of
execution to lay herself down, and die.</p>

<p class='c021'>I possess also the adventures of two
Damsels of Sargans, who particularly
arrested my attention yesterday in the
closet of the Domina.—The picture represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>them as two solitary pilgrims,
both imprest with beauty and innocence
in every feature—features, which seemed
to be not totally unknown to me, and
which even recalled those to my memory,
which my partial friendship once
viewed with such fond admiration,
while gazing on Constantia and her perfidious
sister!—They were represented,
as wandering on a barren mountain covered
with snow, and endeavouring
with inexpressible anxiety in different
quarters to discover an out-let from this
desolate pass, where they must inevitably
perish, unless some higher power should
graciously interpose in their behalf. In
truth, I fancied that I could discover in
the back-ground of the picture a faint
shadow, which seemed to beckon one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the poor wanderers to advance: probably
it meant to convey the idea
of a guardian angel, or a saint, who had
descended from Heaven to guide the
distressed pilgrims out of this fearful
labyrinth.</p>

<p class='c021'>Besides these, I have kept back several
other fragments of less interest,
which I shall not examine, till all those
which I have mentioned have been gone
through, and their contents communicated
to you, dear Oswald. Into the
bargain, the Domina (in hopes, I suppose,
of softening my resentment) sent
me by the hands of a lay-sister the life
of one of her predecessors, who had also
belonged to the family of Sargans, and
respecting whom she thought, that what
she had told me respecting her wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and piety, must needs have powerfully
excited my curiosity. I took the ponderous
roll of parchment with many
thanks; I have already ran through it,
and returned it, for it contained nothing
except that this worthy Abbess was
not only a saint, but was also a woman
of great learning; that she had sacrificed
to the Muses at the same time with
Walter of Vogelfeld, the Counts of
Hapsburg and Welsh-Neuburg, the Abbot
of Einsiedel, and the Bishop of
Constance, and had carried off the prize
from those distinguished Authors; and
finally, that she had instituted a weekly
meeting of literati at the house of Rudiger
Manstein, the burgo-master of Zurich.</p>

<p class='c021'>These particulars possest very few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>charms for me; and the moment that
I was left to myself, I had recourse to
my precious stolen treasure, of which
I shall immediately communicate to you
as much, as I have as yet had leisure to
peruse. Oh! my kind Oswald, will
you not blame me, when I confess,
that even this interesting occupation was
insufficient to banish Montfort from my
mind? Yet to waste another thought
on this paragon of human perfidy is too
great a weakness—I will return to my
parchments, in hopes to collecting from
the sorrows of others resolution enough
to endure my own with patience.</p>

<p class='c026'>It affords the mind a melancholy
pleasure to look back in the evening of
life, and contemplate the path which
conducted us to that place of shelter,
where tranquillity awaits us, and which
at length appears in sight. Yet in such
a moment we obtain but an imperfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>view of the scenes through which we
past; and the sensations which we at
the time experienced, have already lost
much of their poignancy. The chillness
of approaching night makes us almost
forget our sufferings, while toiling under
the heat of the mid-day sun; and our
eye glides easily along the deep vallies in
which we feared to lose our way, and
over the lofty mountains which it cost
us so much labour to ascend—The whole
now seems blended together, and we
perceive scarcely any thing but a level
surface; for the distance of those objects
which we have left behind, and
the darkness growing deeper with every
moment, delude our eyes, and hide from
us almost every thing, which once inspired
us with such well-founded terror.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Alas! the <i>pleasures</i> of our pilgrimage
are lost to us, as well as its difficulties
and its dangers! we no longer see the
flowers of the vale, in which we loitered;
we hear no more the murmur of the
brook, whose clear streams refreshed us
when fainting with fatigue and thirst!
we retain of the whole but one sensation;
that the whole is <i>past</i>!—and we
wonder not a little, when the transient
recollection of former events occasionally
flits before us, how such trifles could
have possest the power of affecting us
with violence so extreme.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such are our feelings in the decline of
life; feelings which you too, beloved-ones,
for whom I trace these lines,
which you, my Amalberga, and you, my
gentle Emmeline, will experience at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>appointed hour. Alas! before that
hour arrives, you must wander through
a long and painful way, counting many
a step of toil, and many a tear of sorrow:
I feel it to be my duty once more
to examine the road by which I have
past myself; and by explaining to you
the obstacles which impeded me in <i>my</i>
progress, I hope to enable you to overcome
those, which may present themselves
before you in your own.</p>

<p class='c021'>The spring of my life was bright
and lovely. I was educated with the
most illustrious young women of the
age, and numbered the children of sovereigns
among my play-mates. The
daughters of the Count of Hapsburg lived
with me like sisters; and even when
Rudolf was elected Emperor, and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>father’s elevation authorized them to expect
to share the thrones of the first
Sovereigns of Europe, still did our
friendship continue in full force. What
have innocence and inexperienced youth
to do with dignity and grandeur?
Things of this nature only furnished us
with a subject for mirth; we past in review
the Princes, both young and old,
who solicited the good graces of the Emperor’s
daughters; we discussed freely
their merits and defects, portioned them
out among our society, and amused
ourselves with jesting at the unfortunate
maiden, to whom the worst lot fell.
The number of these illustrious suitors
was seven; and as the Princesses with
myself made exactly the same number, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>necessarily came in for my share in this
allotment.</p>

<p class='c021'>Unfortunately, what at first was mere
jesting at length became serious. The
Duke of Saxony, who at his first arrival
seemed to limit all his wishes to the possession
of the Princess Matilda, (Rudolf’s
eldest daughter,) began to imagine, that
her companion Urania was the superior
beauty of the two. As it was generally
believed (both on account of the uniformity
which prevailed in our society,
and of our never being separated) that
I was the sister of my friends, the Duke
thought it a matter of very little consequence,
to which of the Emperor’s
daughters he paid his addresses; and he
showed his election in my favour so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>plainly and so publicly, that Rudolf ordered
me to quit his court. My removal
was so sudden, that no step could
be taken by the Duke in this important
business: my father had fallen in
the late popular commotions at Basle;
I had never known my mother; I was
consigned to the guardianship of an
uncle, who had purchased considerable
possessions in the neighbourhood of the
Rhætian Alps, where he resided far
from the tumult of the court in freedom
and tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Leopold Venosta received me
with open arms. Painful as had been
my separation from the friends of my
childhood, still I was not insensible to
the charm of being released from the
chains of court etiquette, even though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the chains which I had borne had been so
light and easy. The air of liberty fanned
my cheeks at every step I took; the
peasants of Rhætia (who had now almost
universally shaken off the fetters of their
lordly masters) celebrated on all sides
the feast of freedom, and invited the
neighbouring inhabitants of the Valteline
to participate in their happiness.
Oh! what delightful scenes
were these for a young and feeling heart!—and
yet I had not sufficient experience
to perceive their whole beauty
and singularity.—Too often is liberty
purchased dearly by the effusion of
blood; and joy at obtaining the so long
wished-for blessing is sullied by melancholy
recollections of the means, by
which that blessing was obtained. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><i>this</i> instance, it was the reward of temperance
and industry, which had at
length succeeded in their efforts to burst
the chains of luxury and oppression.
Knights and Monks, the former owners
of these possessions, had long indulged
without reflection or restraint every
caprice of their voluptuous fancies, till
they became the debtors of their own
vassals; who in the mean while had
been advancing silently towards their
grand object through diligence in labour
and propriety in morals, and now
were able to set at defiance those, whose
slaves and victims they had been so
long. The impoverished libertines found
themselves without resource; they
were obliged to rest contented with
bestowing angry looks on their enfranchised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>vassals, as often as accident
brought them in their way, and with
indulging their spleen in intemperate
railing at (what <i>they</i> termed) the caprice
of fortune.</p>

<p class='c021'>But Count Leopold belonged not to
the number of these reduced Lords.
His opulence grew with every day; his
possessions were increased by the purchase
of those, which the debts of his
neighbours compelled them to dispose of.
Neither had the country reason to lament,
that so much power was concentrated
in his hands.</p>

<p class='c021'>He allowed his vassals sufficient independence
to prevent their sighing after
a greater share of freedom; he parcelled
out some of his estates into small farms,
and bestowed them on the most industrious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>among his people; he even induced
several of the inhabitants of the
Valteline to settle upon his possessions,
by allotting to them a portion of valuable
but hitherto uncultivated land,
which liberally replaced to them what
little they abandoned in their own distracted
country.</p>

<p class='c021'>Oh! believe me, my children, the occupation
renders us almost equal to the
angels, when we employ our power in
bidding some desart teem with harvest,
and making it the habitation of happy
creatures! I have witnessed many of
these transformations, which the Princes
of the earth could produce so often and
so easily, had they but the inclination.
It is in their power to copy the benevolence
and might of the Creator; but they
chuse rather to imitate his chastising justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to convert the dwellings of men
into heaps of stones, and to pour a deluge
of blood over the smiling fruitful
vallies.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the Lords of that part of
Switzerland, whose chief possessions
now belonged to my uncle, the Counts
of Carlsheim held the most distinguished
place. Ethelbert (the only
remaining descendant of this family,
at least as far as we knew) scarcely
inherited from his father the tenth part
of that property, which once belonged
to his forefathers. Grief and vexation
had bowed the young man to the
ground; he sought to improve his fortune
by entering into the service of
foreign princes, failed in the attempt,
and returned sorrowing to repair the
ruined castles which still were his own,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and to collect the fragments of his fallen
greatness. He had no reason to reproach
<i>himself</i> as the author of his distress;
yet the consciousness of his
situation and the feelings of wounded
pride kept him in a constant state
of humiliation, which became particularly
painful at the sight of those, who
had established their prosperity on
the ruins of that of the house of Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c021'>Influenced by these sentiments, did
Ethelbert most studiously avoid all intercourse
with my uncle. On none of
those occasions, which usually bring
knights and noblemen together, did he
ever appear, if there was the slightest
probability of Count Leopold’s being
present; and in spite of all my uncle’s
endeavours to form an acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>with this young warrior, (for whom
more reasons than one induced him to
feel a lively interest,) still would his efforts
in all likelihood have failed of success,
had not a circumstance occurred,
which absolutely enjoined their meeting,
and which was the first link of a connexion
which ... dare I say it?... which
should never have been formed. Yet
the ordinations of eternal Wisdom ought
not to be censured: I press my finger
on my lip, and am silent.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the bosom of a tranquil valley
situated near the Rhine rose the walls
of a monastery, which in point of wealth
was only inferior to the monks of Saint
Basil in Solothurn, and to the valuable
endowments and extensive possessions of
the Great Lady of Zurich. Since time
immemorial had this district belonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to the Lords of Carlsheim; and they
were so conscious of its worth, that
when they sold the rest of their estates
beyond the power of redemption, they
had only parted with this as a pledge.
My uncle had already entered without
success into various negociations with
Count Werner (Ethelbert’s father) on
this subject; and after the old man’s
death, he had found his son equally
determined never to relinquish entirely
his right to “the jewel of the land,” for
such was the popular name of the Cloister
in the Wood. Various means were proposed
to my uncle (several by the
monks themselves) for subduing the
obstinacy of the original possessor: but
Leopold’s tender conscience thought
some unjust, and some unfeeling, and
every thing remained as it was.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>—“Let us not,” he always answered,
when prest upon this subject, “let
us not rob this young man of the flattering
hope, that by means of his claims
on this delightful territory he may one
day be enabled to get a firm footing in
the land of his once opulent inheritance!
I will not be the man who deprives
him of it; far more willingly would I
lend him my aid towards realizing his
expectations, were I assured that he is
really the character for which I take him.
In the mean while, let him continue to
feast his imagination with the hope of
one day enjoying the treasures said to be
buried in the Abbey of Curwald, and
with the rest of those chimæras which
have been painted to me in such brilliant
colours for the purpose of seducing me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to seize <i>that</i> by force of arms, to which
without Ethelbert’s voluntary agreement
I can never possess a satisfactory
right.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>It is but too certain, that no means
were left untried, which might exasperate
my uncle against Ethelbert of
Carlsheim; who on <i>his</i> side suffered
many an interested adviser to assail his
ear with similar representations. Things
were carried to such a length, that feudal
war would certainly have been declared,
and the dwellings of tranquillity
must have been deluged with an ocean of
blood, had not Count Venosta’s generosity
induced him to give way on all possible
occasions.</p>

<p class='c021'>To talk over calmly these and similar
circumstances with Ethelbert in person,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>such was my uncle’s object in endeavouring
to throw himself in his way;
and the obstinate care, with which the
latter avoided every explanation, might
as well be ascribed to a sentiment of
false pride which made him feel humiliated
by Count Venosta’s superior
wealth, or to the insinuations of ill-disposed
advisers, as to envy, or malignity,
or any other bad feature in his character.
Count Leopold and myself had always
made it a rule to consider Ethelbert’s
actions in the most favourable
light. It is true, we had both been
long the inhabitants of a court, the
proper atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust;
but on our first arrival among
the frank and honest children of Helvetia,
we dismissed those enemies of rural peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>for ever, and determined to be open-hearted
with those whose hearts were
so open to us.</p>

<p class='c021'>The circumstance which at length
brought my uncle and Count Ethelbert
together, was a dispute between the
monks of Curwald and their Abbot;
and which at last was carried to such a
pitch, that it became necessary to refer
it to the cloister’s liege-lord. But who
was this same liege-lord? was it Leopold,
who was in actual possession of the revenue,
or Ethelbert, in whom the legal
right still vested? The monks appealed
from one to the other over and over
again, and at length it became absolutely
necessary that a meeting should take
place between them, in order that the
business might be finally adjusted.</p>

<p class='c021'>My uncle had never forbidden my interference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>in matters, which did not exactly
fall within the province of women;
nor indeed would it have been in my
power to remain inactive on this occasion,
in which the honour and welfare
of those persons who (after my uncle)
were most dear to me, were very deeply
implicated.</p>

<p class='c021'>Christian, the persecuted Abbot of
Curwald, was my father-confessor; the
Prior Matthias, who shared with him
the unmerited hatred of the monks, had
been my instructor in botany, one of
my most favourite studies, and which the
Rhætian mountains afforded me every
means of cultivating with success. I
knew the excellence of both these men,
and exerted all the powers of female
persuasion, which consist in tears and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>entreaties, to keep my uncle steady in
the interests of my venerable friends.
I was too anxious about the issue of
this affair to suffer Count Venosta to go
alone to the place, which had been appointed
for the interview between him
and his rival. Report had informed me,
that Ethelbert appeared disposed to protect
the persecutors of innocence; I resolved,
that he should be made thoroughly
aware of the real state of the case;
nor could I suppose, that any thing more
could be requisite in order to obtain the
decision, which I so ardently desired to
hear pronounced. I was still to learn,
that it is possible to act in opposition to
a principle, of whose justice we are
thoroughly convinced.</p>

<p class='c021'>They say, that Female Innocence, forgetful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of herself while she is occupied
with the interests of others, was never
known to supplicate without success. My
uncle had exerted all his powers of argument
without producing conviction in
the bosom of the Count of Carlsheim. He
was silent, and I was now permitted to
advance a few representations on the
subject. I spoke not much; but I
spoke with force and feeling, and I
flattered myself, that I could read in
Ethelbert’s radiant eyes, that what I
said had not totally failed of its effect.
He answered not; but he cast on me a
look so full of expression, that I felt my
cheeks covered with blushes, hastily let
fall my veil, and retreated towards my
uncle:</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Count Venosta,” said Ethelbert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>at length, “here is my hand! decide
the business according to your own
pleasure. So fair and virtuous a Damsel
would never support the cause of
guilt! the discontented monks shall keep
their superior—and if the Abbot wishes
to secure their obedience for ever, let
him only request his powerful advocate
to exert upon <i>them</i> the same powers of
persuasion, which she has just now employed
upon <i>me</i>, and he cannot fail to
obtain his object. Methinks the Man
might make himself Lord of the whole
universe, would he but use this means,
and though loaded with crimes might
steal himself into Paradise, covered by
the protecting mantle of such a
saint.—”</p>

<p class='c021'>These compliments seemed to me not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>less free than flattering. A look too
of my uncle’s informed me, that they
were by no means to his taste, and I
quitted the room embarrassed and uneasy.</p>

<p class='c021'>I had the satisfaction to see my friends
justified and reinstated in their dignities,
in defiance of their numerous foes; but
I had also the mortification to experience
some consequences of my well-intended
interference, which were by no means
agreeable. The first was a very severe
remonstrance from Count Venosta respecting
the ardour, or the importunity
as he termed it, with which I had prest
my suit upon Ethelbert.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Had Urania been a simple Alpine
shepherdess,” said my uncle, “who, concealed,
among her native mountains, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>never heard of the insolent expectations,
which men ground upon the slightest
demonstration of female good-will
towards them, I might, perhaps, find
some excuse for the free tone with
which she spoke to a stranger, and the
tender expression which she infused
into her supplicating looks; but Urania,
educated in a Court, should have been
more upon her guard. Handsome as
are his features, the Count of Carlsheim’s
bold and ardent gaze was such as by no
means gave me a favourable opinion of
his delicacy; and still less was I pleased
by the liberty which he took of addressing
you in a strain of flattery so undisguised.
Hitherto I have been disposed
to entertain a favourable opinion of the
young man; but I confess, what I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>seen of him to-day has shaken my goodwill
not a little.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I only answered Count Leopold’s
warning speech by a respectful silence;
and I afterwards reproached myself for
the manner in which I had acted, though
I was unconscious what I had done, for
which I deserved to be reproached.
My heart was innocent; my intention
was pure; the consequences of the step
which I had taken, however, soon convinced
me that I had really committed
an error.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert of Carlsheim, he who, during
whole years that my uncle sought to obtain
his acquaintance, was never to be
found; he, who even now that they were
at length known to each other, seemed
by no means eager to cultivate a closer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>intercourse with the family of Venosta,
from the time of our first meeting presented
himself before <i>me</i> almost every
day. If I sought the neighbouring
church, it always so happened that he had
chosen exactly the same hour for paying
his devotions—if I sat in my balcony,
he was sure to ride past the Castle—at
the rural feasts, for which among our
vassals an excuse was never wanting,
and from which I dared not absent myself
through fear of mortifying the
good people, Ethelbert’s hand was
always offered to conduct me to the
dance. At length it so chanced, that
I was under the necessity of confessing
that it was to him, that I owed the preservation
of my life. One evening as I
was proceeding towards the Castle in
the twilight, a procession of villagers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>returning from a wedding, happened to
cross my path, accompanied by a variety
of instruments which produced the most
noisy and discordant sounds imagiable.
The white banners fluttering
before the eyes of my palfrey, and the
clattering cymbals which stunned her
ears, caused her to take fright and set
off at full speed; and in all probability
she would have dashed with
me from the brow of a neighbouring
precipice, to which she was hastening,
had not Count Ethelbert fortunately
heard my shrieks. He rescued
me from my danger, and in return had
the happiness (as he called it) to accompany
me back to the Castle, and took an
opportunity to make by the way a declaration
of the most passionate affection.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Another time, late at night I was
alarmed by a fire breaking out in my
anti-chamber, and the flames spread with
sufficient rapidity to make me swoon
through terror. When I recovered, I
found myself supported by Count Ethelbert,
who advised me to save myself by
flight from the threatening danger, and
seemed perfectly ready to assist me in
putting his advice in execution. However,
as I had now regained my presence
of mind sufficiently to see, that there
was no absolute necessity for taking
such a step, my flight extended no
further than to my uncle’s chamber,
whither I requested to be conveyed
without delay.</p>

<p class='c021'>Leopold received my preserver with
marked coldness, and concluded his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>expressions of gratitude with enquiring—“by
what strange though fortunate
accident he had arrived there so speedily
and so exactly at the time, when his
assistance was most wanted?”—Ethelbert
in his answer talked much of the
good angels who watch over the favourites
of Heaven, which my uncle heard
without any great appearance of satisfaction;
and as soon as the Count of
Carlsheim had taken his departure, I
received a very serious lecture respecting
him. My uncle was inclined to believe,
that the accident which had lately
alarmed my palfrey, and the fire which
had thrown me under Ethelbert’s protection,
were both devices intended to
bind me to him by the chains of gratitude.
It was at least certain, that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>sooner had my accident taken place,
than the bridal procession disappeared;
and the fire had done no other damage,
than consuming part of the arras with
which my anti-chamber was hung.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“If the Count of Carlsheim is
anxious to win your affections,” said
my uncle, “why does he not take the
straight road to obtain them? why does
he not explain his views respecting you
to <i>me</i>? there was a time, when I should
not have refused you to him, and in
which I intended to have done an act
of justice by making him once more
lord over the possessions of his ancestors,
by giving him the hand of Urania, the
future heiress of Carlsheim and Sargans.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I knew not, what intelligence or what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>observations could have induced Count
Leopold (who was generally so much
inclined to think well of every one) so
soon to view Ethelbert’s actions in an
unfavourable light. As for myself, I
gave these accusations by no means
implicit confidence; and I strove to
find excuses for the conduct of a man,
who every time that I saw him made a
stronger impression on my heart, and
who daily rendered it more difficult for
me to suspect him of any thing wrong.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert of Carlsheim was unfortunate,
and had been deprived of the
greatest part of those possessions, which
ought to have been his birth right;
this alone would have been a sufficient
reason for my viewing him with interest;
but how much was that interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>increased by the discovery, that he
employed the little power, which he
still possest, in relieving the misfortunes
of others; and that by the protection
which he granted the opprest, he had
himself incurred the animosity of many
powerful foes? what could be more
noble and more generous than such a
proceeding, and how was it possible to
suppose, that a man who could act thus,
could ever deserve the most distant
appearance of suspicion?</p>

<p class='c021'>Edith, Countess of Mayenfield, was
compelled to fly from her castle, by her
bitter enemy the ambitious Abbot of
St. Gall: she was a widow, and there
were suspicions (and those no slight
ones) that she was indebted for the
removal of her husband to a present of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>wine from the cellar of this dignified
prelate. Willingly would he have also
sacrificed the unprotected lady, who
was the more dangerous obstacle to the
enjoyment of his hopes, inasmuch as
she was daily expected to produce a
child, which (if a son) would be entitled
to the whole possessions of his deceased
father.</p>

<p class='c021'>Edith therefore was compelled to
seek safety in flight; the time of her
delivery was near; she was beset with
enemies on all sides; nor could she
doubt what would be the fate of herself
and her offspring, should he fall into
the Abbot’s hands. In this dreadful
situation she summoned up all her
courage, and under the protecting mantle
of the night employed the only means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of saving herself from destruction, which
the severity of her fate had now left
her. Her wearied horses refused to
bear her further, and she was still far
distant from the place, in which she
hoped to find shelter and assistance.
She doubted not, that the Abbot would
pursue her; not a moment was to be
lost; she quitted her litter, and resolved
to prosecute her painful way on foot,
unaccompanied except by her orphan
daughter, the young and lovely Minna.
She ordered her attendants to pursue
their journey with as much diligence as
possible, hoping by this artifice to lead
her pursuers astray. As for herself, she
determined to conceal herself in the depth
of the forest, thinking she should find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>there some retired cottage, in which she
might recover herself from anxiety and
fatigue, and give birth in tranquil security
to her unfortunate fatherless infant.
As to being betrayed to her tyrant, she
was too well acquainted with the honest
and benevolent temper of the inhabitants
of these mountains to harbour any apprehensions
on that head.</p>

<p class='c021'>The paths through which she wandered
were solitary. At length the
trampling of a steed was heard; and
soon after a knight, unaccompanied,
presented himself before the unfortunate
lady, who, supported by the powerless
hand of the youthful Minna, was scarcely
able to prevent herself from sinking on
the ground: this solitary knight was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Count Ethelbert; he was returning from
the chace, and had sent his attendants
forward.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Countess of Mayenfield found it
unnecessary to represent to him, how
much her situation required assistance,
or to explain her name and the dangers
which still menaced her. Before she had
time to request his services, Ethelbert
was already occupied in serving her: his
pealing horn soon collected his attendants
round him. A slight but easy
litter was constructed with all diligence;
and before an hour elapsed, the fugitives
rejoiced to find themselves within
the sheltering walls of a castle, whose
strength was capable of defying the
malice of their enemies, in case they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>should attempt to deprive them forcibly
of their friendly retreat.</p>

<p class='c021'>It so happened that Count Venosta
also had dedicated this same day to the
chace: the sport had enticed him to a
distance from home. Midnight had
long been past; and I still sat at my
spinning wheel surrounded by my
maidens, waiting with most anxious
expectation for my uncle’s return. A
thousand painful thoughts and confused
images glanced across my imagination,
in which, as usual, Count Ethelbert was
not forgotten; suddenly the folding
doors of my chamber were thrown
open, and the object of my thoughts
stood before me, almost breathless
through haste and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Dear lady,” said he, “I come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>ask a boon of you. A guest of no mean
rank has arrived at my castle, and there
is no female there to bid her welcome:
a litter waits at your door; suffer me to
entreat that you will let it convey you
to my residence.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Sir Knight, are you in your
senses? This extraordinary request....”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Is the boldest, the most unpardonable,
that fancy can imagine: but
judge by the want of preparation with
which I propose it, how urgent is the
necessity for its being gratified without
delay.—”</p>

<p class='c021'>The Count of Carlsheim had by no
means chosen the most fortunate moment
for obtaining any favour at all
from me, much less one of so extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>a nature. In solitude I had
reflected calmly and seriously on my
uncle’s warning: the frightened palfrey,
and the fire so easily extinguished, came
into my head; and the uneasiness in
which Count Venosta’s absence had
obliged me to pass the last hours, by no
means inclined me to view these circumstances
so much to Ethelbert’s advantage
as usual: at that moment I saw
him with my uncle’s eyes; and of course
this proposal appeared to me as nothing
but a most bare-faced attempt on my
lover’s part to betray me into his
power.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“You are offended?” said Ethelbert,
who read displeasure strongly
painted on my every feature; “well
then! I must have recourse to a more
eloquent pleader.”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Saying this, he hastened into the anti-chamber,
and returned with a little
beautiful child, whose countenance expressed
the deepest anxiety and sorrow,
and whose blue eyes filled with tears
strengthened the impression, which was
made on me by her unexpected appearance.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Ah! dear good lady!” said the
little mourner, while she sank on her
knees before me, and kist my hand; “I
entreat you, do what this knight requests
of you! My mother and myself
are alone in a gloomy castle, where
there are none but stern-looking men,
with great beards and heavy swords;
and my mother is so very ill! and she
asked so anxiously, ‘was there no lady
who would comfort and assist her in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>her sickness!’ and then this knight who
saved us from dying in the forest, answered,
that he knew a lady whom he
loved as his sister, and that he would
bring her to my mother, if she could be
persuaded to follow him; and then he
took me along with him, that I might
help to prevail on you to come and be
kind to my poor mother: and now I
am here, you <i>will</i> be prevailed on; I
am sure of it, because you look on me
so kindly! Come, dear good lady!
Come!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I kist the pretty suppliant without
thoroughly comprehending what it was
that she requested me to do, and cast an
inquiring look upon Ethelbert. He
related his adventure with the Countess
of Mayenfield in so interesting a manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that it was impossible for me to hesitate
a moment longer, as to what course I
should pursue. Indeed, the history of
this unfortunate lady was not unknown
to me, when Ethelbert mentioned her
name: her misfortunes had for some
time been the general subject of conversation,
and had already cost me many
a sympathising tear, and many an ardent
wish to find some means of giving her
assistance.</p>

<p class='c021'>I was deaf to all the suggestions of
prudence, and threw myself into the
litter, wishing that I could have given the
horses wings, so eager was I to reach the
illustrious sufferer. My nurse accompanied
me; a discreet and benevolent
woman, who was likely to be of much
more use to the Countess than myself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>So completely was I occupied by my
anxiety for the poor lady, that I scarcely
paid any attention to Ethelbert’s tender
expressions of gratitude, or to the representations
of my nurse, who hinted
to me with some appearance of discontent,
that I had acted with rather too
much rashness in this business; she
assured me, that <i>her</i> presence at the
Castle of Carlsheim would be quite
sufficient without my giving myself the
trouble to go there; and she confest,
that she thought Count Venosta would
have good reason to be offended at
finding on his return home, that I had
quitted his house during his absence
with a young knight, in spite of darkness
and an heavy fall of snow.</p>

<p class='c021'>We reached the Castle; the sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>us served to give new life to the exhausted
lady, who surrounded by none
but men had met with but sorry attendance.
She embraced me, and called
me by the tender name of sister. I soon
confided her to the care of my nurse,
and quitted her chamber for the purpose
of making arrangements for her
treatment; and I gave my directions in
a tone of as much earnestness, as had I
been in my uncle’s castle. Anxiety
about the Countess made me take the
whole business upon my own hands; I
saw nothing extraordinary in what I
was doing, and could by no means conceive,
why Count Ethelbert’s people examined
me with looks of such surprise;
nor why he was himself always by
my side, expressing the most excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>delight and satisfaction at every thing
that I did, and loading me with such
a profusion of thanks, that it was utterly
impossible for me to ascribe them all to
the interest, which he felt about his
unfortunate guest.</p>

<p class='c021'>Before day-break, Edith became the
mother of a boy; and never did any
other mother feel equal rapture with
hers, when for the first time she prest
him to her bosom. In this new-born
babe she embraced not merely her
child, but the future conqueror of her
foes, and the preserver of her family.
Nothing more than the birth of this
boy was necessary to destroy every
claim of the avaricious Abbot of St.
Gall upon Mayenfield, and reduce
him to the condition of a feudal dependent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Count Ethelbert on <i>his</i> part
neglected not to spread abroad the news
of the birth of a young Count of Mayenfield,
and to invite through his heralds
both friends and foes to convince themselves
by their eyes of the existence of
this infant nobleman.</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Venosta had experienced no
trifling anxiety on being informed of
my midnight excursion, the motive of
which no one was able to explain to
his satisfaction. He determined to examine
into the real nature of the transaction
himself; accordingly the first
sunbeams saw him cross the draw-bridge
of Ethelbert’s castle, accompanied by
his whole train of hunters, whom he
had ordered to hold themselves prepared
for a serious engagement, in case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the nature of things should make it
necessary to come to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Count of Carlsheim was already
abroad, employed in business which
regarded the adventure of the past
night. My uncle found me sitting by
the bed-side of the newly-delivered
Countess, whose ardent thanks for the
assistance, which I had afforded her,
instantly removed every trace of anger
from his brow; and the severe lecture
which he intended to bestow on me,
was softened into a gentle remonstrance
against my acting in general with too
much precipitation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert returned; he shared with
my uncle and myself the office of presenting
the new-born heir of Mayenfield
at the baptismal fount, and we gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the child its father’s name, Ludolf.
From motives of propriety, we were
all anxious to remove the invalid (who
earnestly entreated me not to abandon
her) to my uncle’s castle; but she was
at first too weak to bear the journey,
and I was under the necessity of submitting
for some time longer to act as
the mistress of Count Ethelbert’s castle.</p>

<p class='c021'>Now then affairs wore that appearance,
which I am convinced it had
always been my lover’s plan to give
them. Doubtless had he thought proper,
he might have contrived to show his
fair guest all the duties of hospitality
without any interference of mine: but
he eagerly made use of the opportunity
which presented itself, to draw
me into a more intimate connection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>He endeavoured to convince me by his
reliance on my humanity of the esteem
which he entertained for <i>my</i> character;
and at the same time he hoped to inspire
me with a favourable opinion of
his own, by making me a daily witness
of the noble treatment which he afforded
to a stranger, who had no claim to his
protection except her need of it, and
who could make him no other return
for his kindness, except the involving
<i>him</i> in her own difficulties and dangers.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert’s plan succeeded with me
completely, and even my uncle began
to view him in a more favourable light.
Both were equally interested about the
Countess, and swore to exert themselves
to the utmost in endeavouring to reinstate
her and her new-born son in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>rights, which were still detained from
them by the Abbot of St. Gall; the
similarity of their objects naturally
induced a sort of confidence between
them; and Ethelbert lost no opportunity
of turning this confidence to the
best account. Perhaps he already reckoned
himself on the point of obtaining
that, which had long been the mark at
which he aimed, though he had never
acknowledged it in words; namely, the
possession of my hand: but my uncle
soon gave a fresh proof, that at present
he by no means looked forward to, or
desired a connection between the families
of Carlsheim and Venosta.</p>

<p class='c021'>The history of my nocturnal journey
(many gave it the name of an elopement,)
had not been kept a secret; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>situation of the Countess’s affairs made
it necessary for her to receive several
strangers; they always found me at her
side, saw that I acted as the mistress of
Count Ethelbert’s house, and the remarks
to which all this gave occasion
were frequently by no means to my
credit. Some asserted, that I was already
betrothed to the Lord of Carlsheim;
others fabricated out of facts and guesses
such a story, as offended my feelings
too severely to admit of my repeating
it here, and which no sooner came to
my uncle’s knowledge, than he resolved
at all events to remove me from so
unusual a situation. The invalid was now
sufficiently recovered to bear the fatigue
of a journey; and an abode in the house
of the potent Count Venosta was likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to furnish her both with more consequence
and security, than she could
expect to find at the Castle of Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c021'>My uncle and Ethelbert looked gloomily;
my heart was heavy and sad:
the fair Edith of Mayenfield alone exprest
in words, what no one else was
willing to declare to the other.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! Heaven,” she cried at taking
leave of him, who had till then been
her protector, while she prest mine and
Ethelbert’s hands fast together, between
her own “unite these two noblest
souls, with which you ever blest humanity:
this is the best recompense for
such generosity and such disinterested
friendship, as I have experienced from
them both!”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Edith’s expressive eyes were directed
towards heaven; Ethelbert and myself
blushed as we gazed on each other,
without being able to pronounce a
syllable. Methought, Ethelbert <i>should</i>
have spoken on this occasion;—but he
was silent.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Countess was long our guest.
Open feud was declared between her
defenders and the obstinate Abbot of
St. Gall, who was worsted in every
skirmish without ever being entirely
subdued. The contest was carried on
for a considerable time: in the mean
while my uncle (to whom age advanced
with steps so lingering, that no one
could easily have guest his years) discovered,
that the charms of the fair
widow were still of great power: yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>perhaps it was I, to whom the idea first
suggested itself, that an union between
them would be productive of happiness
on both sides. I soon observed, that my
hints were far from disagreeable to either
party; and I exulted in the hope of soon
beholding my friend and my benefactor
united in a new course of domestic
happiness.</p>

<p class='c021'>When I imparted my designs to Count
Ethelbert, (who was now a frequent
visitor at our castle) he listened to me
with the greatest astonishment. His
countenance at this moment assumed
an expression, which I had never seen
it wear before.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Lady!” said he, “am I awake,
or dreaming?—An union, which must
deprive you of your fairest expectations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and will put a stranger in possession of
all those rights which ought to be your
own, is such an union contrived by
yourself?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“And when did Count Ethelbert,”
I answered with a look of surprise not
inferior to his own, “when did Count
Ethelbert discover the least trace of
selfishness in my character? it is impossible,
that such mean considerations
should really hold a place in his bosom;
or is this only intended as a trial of his
friend?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>He bit his lip, and was for some time
silent. My eyes were fixed upon him
steadily; and it was long, before he
could recover himself sufficiently to
assume a different air, and explain to
me, that in an affair in which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>not personally the slightest concern, he
could only be anxious about my interest;
and he advanced many arguments
to prove, that the most noble and generous
soul might feel very differently on
occasions which regarded his friend,
than he would have felt in affairs, which
only related to himself.</p>

<p class='c021'>I believed every thing that Ethelbert
told me; in fact he was soon after
complaisant enough to allow, that my
reasons were not entirely without weight,
and at length even went so far as to
declare that on consideration it appeared
to him very possible, that an union
between the Count Venosta and the
widow of Ludolf of Mayenfield might
be an advantageous event for <i>all</i> parties.
He also promised, that as soon as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>next expedition against the Abbot of
St. Gall should have taken place, he
would come to my assistance, and use
every power of entreaty and persuasion
to forward this connection, which I so
ardently desired.</p>

<p class='c021'>This expedition was directed against
one of the Castles, which our common
enemy detained from its rightful owner;
on the morning appointed for its taking
place, out forces set out before daybreak,
in pursuit of a victory of which
they reckoned themselves secure.</p>

<p class='c021'>My friend and myself had already
seen our heroes return victorious from
their excursions too often, to make us
think it necessary to accompany their
departure with signs and expressions of
anxiety. We had exactly ascertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the time, when we might expect them
back, and had laid a plan (with the assistance
of such warriors as were left
behind) for receiving them with all the
pageantry and honours of conquest.
A procession of knights and ladies was
intended to welcome them on their
return, and at the head of the joyous
band was to wave a banner adorned
with mottos and emblems; this gorgeous
ornament was to be embroidered
by our own hands, and our needles
were plyed with unwearied industry, in
order that it might be finished at the
appointed time.</p>

<p class='c021'>While engaged at this delightful and
now half completed task, infrequently
termed the lovely Edith in jest “my
most venerable aunt;” and in revenge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>she embroidered upon a vacant shield
the united initials of Ethelbert and
Urania. By degrees our discourse took
a more serious turn. She declared to
me her surprise at Ethelbert’s persisting
in not publicly declaring his love for me,
a circumstance which had long been
the cause of much secret uneasiness and
curiosity to myself. She assured me also,
that she had no wish more ardent in
becoming Countess of Vonosta, than to
be authorized to insist on an explanation
from the bashful knight (as she called
the Count of Carlsheim,) and to become
the instrument of accomplishing his
happiness and mine.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was at this moment, that a sudden
noise in the court of the Castle interrupted
our work and our discourse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>We sprang from our seats: the trampling
of horses would have led us to
suppose, that our lovers were returned,
had so speedy a termination of their
business been possible. We bade our
maidens hasten to enquire the news, and
flew ourselves to the window in order
to learn (if possible), with our own eyes,
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c021'>Instantly the Countess started back
with a loud shriek, and fainted; nor
was my own condition much better on
beholding in the court a single warrior
covered with blood, and holding two
unmounted horses, whose trappings
spoke too plainly the fate of their
riders!</p>

<p class='c021'>—“What has happened?” I cried
from the balcony, in a voice half choaked
by anxiety.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>—“Ah! noble lady!” answered the
messenger, “my lord your uncle ...
the Count of Carlsheim too ... an ambuscade
among the mountains ... both
taken prisoners ... help! help for
heaven’s sake!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Our people hastened to assist the
soldier, who seemed to be desperately
wounded, and could scarcely hold himself
upright through loss of blood; the
agony, which this news occasioned me,
instead of overpowering me like my
friend, gave me additional strength, and
I lost not a moment in hastening to
attempt the rescue of our knights. I
directed the preparations myself, and
before an hour had elapsed, all the
warriors whom my uncle had left behind
to protect the Castle, were completely
armed and ready to set out. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>determined to head them myself; and
being accoutred in a light suit of armour,
I hastened to bid farewell to my afflicted
friend (whom I had committed to the
care of her women), and to comfort her
with the hope of my returning crowned
with success.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“What, Urania?” exclaimed Edith
wringing her hands; “and do you too
leave me?—Heavenly mercy! what will
become of me! take me with you,
Urania, or stab me before you go!
foreboding terrors weigh down my
heart! dreadful as my sufferings have
been already, I feel that I have still much
more to endure! Urania, we shall never
meet again!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I prest my trembling friend to my
heart with affection, recommended her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the kindness of her attendants, and then
hastened, where I was far less invited by
courage and resolution than by urgent
necessity and despair. We gave the
reins to our coursers, flew over the
plain, and soon reached the winding
pass through the mountains, where our
brave friends had been subdued by
treachery and malice. Ah! what a
dreadful sight! the place of combat
floated with blood! various were the
occasions presented to induce our pity
to stop, in the hope of rescuing from
death some of his yet lingering victims:
but still more weighty considerations
compelled us to close our ears against
the cries of suffering humanity, and
pursue our progress without delay.
However, I failed not to leave some of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>people behind to discharge those offices,
which I would so much more gladly
have fulfilled myself; and I charged
them (in case any thing of importance
could be learned from those who still
survived) to lose no time in bringing
me the information.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was from them, that I learned the
road, which the forces of the Abbot of
St. Gall (whose number trebled ours)
had taken with the captive knights. It
was not yet evening, when I reached
the fortress, which had been pointed
out to me as the prison of my friends.</p>

<p class='c021'>We prepared for storming the walls.
I possest among my followers several
experienced warriors, who supplied my
want of intelligence in affairs of this
nature, and who seemed to derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>double strength from witnessing my
resolution, the resolution of a distracted
woman! It was not long, before we
saw a white flag waved by the besieged;
and soon after (having received our
solemn promise for the security of his
invaluable person) we beheld on the
battlements the robber of my beloved
friends, the oppressor of the unprotected
innocent, in short the execrable Abbot
of St. Gall.</p>

<p class='c021'>I had taken off my helmet to cool my
burning cheeks; and my ringlets still
adorned with flowers, which in my
haste I had forgotten to remove, streamed
freely in the wind of evening: the
Abbot therefore easily guest at my sex
and name.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“You are welcome, fair damsel of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Sargans!” said the monk with a malicious
smile; “the friends, of whom you
are in pursuit, are no longer inmates of
these walls: then forbear to persecute
the innocent! lay aside that heavy
armour, which so ill befits your sex,
and enter to partake with us, poor
monks, of a friendly though frugal
entertainment!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I was already preparing to return the
insulter such an answer, as his insolent
speech demanded; but ere I had time
to speak,—“treachery! treachery!”—was
shrieked in my ears by an hundred
voices. I looked round, and saw the
glittering of hostile swords. My people
were beaten back, and the ground was
strewed with their corses—the soldiers
of the perfidious Abbot had stolen upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>us through secret passages, had taken
my followers by surprise, and were
hewing for themselves a way to me
with their faulchions. Terror deprived
me of my senses! what would have
become of me in this dreadful moment
of confusion and fear I know not, had
not my faithful Gertrude, who had
followed me to battle with undaunted
courage, been close to my side; and ere
I fell, she caught me in her arms. The
loss of my helmet made it easy for me
to be recognized by my pale and feminine
features. She seized the casque of
one of the Abbot’s soldiers, who happened
to be struck down near us, and
concealed my face with it; she then
wrapped me in his cloak, on which the
Abbot’s coat of arms was emblazoned;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and under favour of this disguise she
succeeded in extricating me from the
throng, and in conducting me in safety
towards the side, from which the combat
seemed at that time to be retiring.</p>

<p class='c021'>I recovered myself, and we hastened
to seat ourselves on horseback. Gertrude
convinced me that my presence
was now quite unavailing, and that my
being taken prisoner would be unavoidable,
if I suffered the least delay. In
truth, my nerves had been too much
shaken by this last dreadful piece of
treachery to admit of my adopting any
other resource than flight, the woman’s
constant refuge.</p>

<p class='c021'>The darkness of the night enabled us
to escape; and we arrived in safety at
the castle, which (while unacquainted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>with my own want of strength and
ability, and the power and perfidy of
the foe with whom I had to deal) I had
left with such sanguine hopes of victory.
We were obliged to traverse the narrow
pass through the mountains, where the
fatal ambuscade had been stationed in
the morning: as I hastened through it,
methought the groans of dying men
sounded in my ears, and my hair stood
erect, and my blood ran cold, as I
listened. Woman’s weakness re-assumed
it’s rights; and she, who so lately had
dared to trust herself among hostile
faulchions, now trembled at a sound, at
a shadow, which only existed in her
over-heated imagination.</p>

<p class='c021'>I reached the Castle more dead than
alive. We found the Castle-gates closed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>We called in vain for admittance; no
signal was attended to; every thing
within seemed to be silent as the grave:
no glimmering of light was visible in
the high-arched casements, and we were
compelled to pass the night in a small
ruined chapel at no great distance
from the Castle.</p>

<p class='c021'>Convinced, that nothing but the fear
of being surprised by the enemy could
have induced the Castle’s inhabitants to
observe such obstinate discretion, we
waited for morning with the utmost
impatience and anxiety. Perhaps the
enemy might pursue the fugitives hither,
and make himself master of the Castle,
before our vassals could be summoned
to its defence? perhaps, it might already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>have been attacked, and might be at that
very moment in possession of the foe? I
had left the Countess of Mayenfield but
ill-protected. My anxiety to rescue my
uncle and Count Ethelbert had induced
me to leave no one behind, except our
women, the old seneschal, the warder,
and a few domestics.</p>

<p class='c021'>At break of day we again approached
the Castle; we then perceived (what
the extreme darkness of the night had
before prevented our discovering) that
the draw-bridge had not been raised.
We crost it, and on approaching the
gates had the satisfaction to see them
opened for our admittance by the Seneschal.
We were received by the
weak old man with every appearance
of alarm: the first questions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>were asked on both sides related to our
return unaccompanied, and to the ghastly
appearance of the old man; but neither of
us could restrain impatience sufficiently
to give an answer. I hastened into the
court yard, anxious to embrace my
friend, and consult with her, what precautions
should be taken for our future
safety; but the first thing, which met
my eyes on entering, was an heap of
bleeding corses!</p>

<p class='c021'>I started back in horror, and wished
to ask, what dreadful events had taken
place in my absence; but fear and
agony choaked my words. Besides, I
was soon summoned to the assistance of
Gertrude, at whose feet the Seneschal
(who probably had exhausted his little
remaining strength in opening the gates)
had now fallen senseless.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Yet while so many scenes of terror
are reserved for my pen, why do I dwell
with such minuteness on the first? I
will not describe, how the whole shocking
mystery gradually unfolded itself; I
will rather state at once and briefly the
total sum of my misfortune.</p>

<p class='c021'>The only object which after the loss
of Ethelbert and my uncle was still dear
to me, my friend, my Edith, she too had
been torn from me during my unfortunate
expedition. Scarcely had I quitted
her, when a troop of unknown
enemies had forcibly gained entrance;
had either slain or mortally wounded
the few male inhabitants of the Castle;
had confined the women in the upper
apartments; and when they retired after
their bloody work, had conveyed away
with them the Countess of Mayenfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and her weeping children! The robbers
closed the doors after them and fled,
leaving the Castle in that fearful solitude,
which had occasioned me so much
anxiety and surprise. The Warder and
the Seneschal were the only men, whose
wounds had not already terminated their
existence; but fainting through loss of
blood they heard not the signals, which
I made to obtain admittance. It was
morning, before they were sufficiently
recovered to examine into the circumstances
of the former day; and while
the first had dragged his feeble steps
towards the Countess’s apartment, the
other had sought the Castle-portal, with
the intention of obtaining assistance
from the neighbouring villagers.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Countess’s women, with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>hands still fettered, now threw themselves
at my feet, and enquired, what
was become of their beloved mistress,
whom I had imprudently left behind
under such inadequate protection. Grief
for her loss overpowered our apprehensions
of further danger; and had our
foe thought proper to make use of the
present opportunity, he would have
found us an easy prey.</p>

<p class='c021'>About mid-day, some peasants in the
neighbourhood arrived, and brought
with them the young Minna of Mayenfield,
whom they had found weeping
and bewildered among the mountains.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! dear, dear lady!” she exclaimed,
while she threw herself into my
arms “my mother! oh! what have the
villains done with my mother!”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>I could only answer with my tears.
The child too was in such dreadful agitation,
that it was long before I could
obtain from her an explanation of the
manner, in which the Countess had been
conveyed away: as for herself, the
ravishers became weary of her incessant
tears and shrieks, and abandoned her
among the mountains. How painful
must the unhappy mother have felt this
parting with her only daughter! nothing
could have induced her to submit to it,
except the threat of her persecutor to
deprive her also of the baby at her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c021'>The evening was far advanced, before
I could recover myself sufficiently to
take some precautions for our security,
and make such enquiries, as appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to me highly necessary; the gates were
carefully fastened; the draw-bridge was
raised. As our strength was unequal
to the task of burying the dead, we
were obliged to throw the corses into a
ruined well, situated in a back-corner
in a remote part of the Castle: and this
melancholy duty being performed, we
employed ourselves in collecting every
circumstance, which might assist us to
guess at the authors of our late misfortune.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Seneschal, before whose bed the
consultation was held, produced many
weighty reasons for asserting, that the
Abbot of St. Gall (to whose account we
were inclined to set down any wickedness)
in the present instance was perfectly
innocent. As to the person, at whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>door he was disposed to lay the blame, he
obstinately refused to give the least
hint; but he made no scruple of avowing
that he was not without suspicions.</p>

<p class='c021'>The little Minna, who now never
stirred a moment from my side, and
to whom we were not paying the least
attention, interrupted us to say,—“that
she had never heard the Abbot of St.
Gall speak, and that she was sure, that
the voice of the chief robber was not
unknown to her, though she could not
recollect where she had heard it. She
had even said as much, while in his
power; but the only reward of her
recollection had been a blow, which
struck her senseless at his feet. Shortly
after she had been forced from her
mother’s arms, and left among the
mountains.”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>—“Alas, my child,” said I, “you
were probably deceived by some fancied
resemblance!—But what must now be
done? where is the messenger, who
informed us yesterday of the fatal ambuscade?—Perhaps,
he may be able to
give us some insight into the author of
this second attack.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Ah! would to God,” answered
the old Seneschal, “that I had either
examined that messenger more circumstantially,
or at least had watched him
closer! yet who could have imputed
treachery to Dietrich, or suspect a man,
who seemed to be at the point of death,
of an intention to escape?”</p>

<p class='c021'>—“To escape?” I exclaimed; “has
Dietrich fled? when and how did this
take place?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“We were all busy in making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>preparations for binding up his wounds,
of whose pain he complained bitterly, but
which it seems none of us ever saw. We
left him alone for a few moments, and in
the meanwhile he disappeared. We
sought him long, but he was not to be
found; and we finished by conjecturing,
that courage and fidelity had induced
him to follow you in spite of his wounds,
and to endeavour at contributing to his
master’s rescue; though we doubted
not from his apparently weak condition,
that he must have died by the way.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“And why should not your conjecture
have been well-founded? Dietrich
was ever one of Count Venosta’s most
faithful servants.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>The Seneschal assured me, that during
the hostile attack which followed close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>on the heels of Dietrich’s disappearance,
circumstances had occurred, which made
him view the fellow’s escape in a very
different light. He was proceeding to
explain himself more clearly, when the
sound of a trumpet threw us all into
the most violent alarm! every one
hastened to the place, where duty or
inclination called them: the Warder
ascended the watch-tower; my terrified
damsels fled to conceal themselves; in
the mean while, I and the little Minna
descended to the lower battlements, in
order to inform myself at once of the
extent of my danger.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Almighty powers!” I exclaimed,
on casting a fearful look on the plain
before the fortress, which was now
covered with warriors; “is it possible?—my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>uncle’s banner?—Count Ethelbert’s
soldiers too!—surely this must
be a dream!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Venosta now advanced before
the rest, in order to answer in person
the usual questions, which the Warder
asked from the tower; but I had not
patience enough to wait for the termination
of this ceremony. The Castle-gates
were thrown open; the draw-bridge
was let down; and I already was
clasped in the arms of my beloved
uncle, ere I had yet convinced myself,
that his delivery was real.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Yes! my dear child!” exclaimed
Count Leopold, as soon as I had recovered
myself from the first tumult of
delight and astonishment; “yes! I am
free, and knowest thou, to whom we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>are both indebted for life and all that we
possess? ’tis to this hero, whose character
I have so long mistaken, and from
whom my suspicions have till now
with-held the only gift, which is worthy
to reward his merits!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“What!” I replied—“Count
Ethelbert? he, who was made prisoner
at the same moment with yourself?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Heaven be thanked, that he escaped!”
interrupted my uncle. “While
the Abbot’s soldiers (after their successful
ambuscade among the mountains)
were conveying me to their lord, Count
Ethelbert was employed in collecting
his remaining vassals, whom he had left
behind to protect his castle: with these
he hastened to my succour, and this
morning saw my deliverance effected.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Oh! my Urania, help me to discharge
my debts to this excellent man! none
but yourself can do it!—Draw near,
Count Ethelbert, and receive the hand
of the sole heiress of all those possessions,
of which your ancestors formerly were
the lords; the hand of one, who boasts
a still more precious title, the hand of
that beloved-one, whom you have so
long adored in secret.—Why advance
you not? stretch forth your hand, and
clasp that, which Urania has not hesitated
to extend towards you.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert was still silent for a moment:
at length he advanced a few steps, his
left hand placed on the hilt of his sword,
his right upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Count Venosta,” said he, “have I
demanded of you the hand of the heiress
of Sargans?”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>—“I understand; you allude to my
intended union with the Countess of
Mayenfield.—But fear not, that I need
recall my words: when I have restored
your paternal possessions, I shall still
have enough remaining to confer a
rich dowry on my wife.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“I speak not of that: I only ask,
have I ever entreated you to make me
the lovely Urania’s husband?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“No, and I can well guess the
reason of your silence! your fortunes
are fallen; your heart is proud; you
dreaded a rejection: but surely now
there can exist no difference between us.
You are my preserver; I offer you in
gratitude my dearest treasure, and you
love Urania with too much passion
to reject her hand.”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>—“Yes, Count Venosta; yes, I love
her!—but my pride requires that all
the world should know, that I became
your nephew through your own free-will;
without your having been moved
to pity by lovesick entreaties, and without
my having been obliged to enter
into humiliating explanations.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“My friend! my preserver! why
pain me by recollecting at such a time
... but you shall be satisfied!—Now
then, all the world may know, that I
freely offer my niece’s hand to the
Count of Carlsheim, supplicate him to
accept it, and wait his answer with impatience.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“And you, lady?” said Ethelbert.
—“Urania! pronounce my doom!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I was silent; I blushed and cast down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>my eyes. Oh! this noble pride, which
made him hesitate to accept the hand of
the richest heiress in Helvetia, lest he
should be suspected of having sought
it through interested motives, would
have gained him my heart, had it not
already long been his! my uncle was
the interpreter of my looks; I did not
contradict him; my lover clasped me
in his arms for the first time, and I
heard myself called by the title, which
was dearest to me in the world.</p>

<p class='c021'>These moments were heavenly! alas!
how soon were they interrupted by the
most bitter recollections!—my uncle
turned from the scene of our happiness,
and enquired—“where he should find
the Countess of Mayenfield!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Oh Heaven! what did I suffer at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>hearing that question! what did I suffer,
when compelled to answer it!
vainly should I attempt to describe
Count Venosta’s situation, when informed
of the loss of his beauteous
Edith!</p>

<p class='c021'>Men express grief and resentment in
a different manner from us, helpless
females. My narrative of Edith’s carrying
off was followed not by idle complaints,
but by active exertions to recover
her. The wearied soldiery again
seated themselves on horseback, and
were ordered to scour the country
round in pursuit of the ravishers. I
was myself too much interested in the
business to oppose my uncle’s orders;
but Count Ethelbert, who retained more
presence of mind than the rest, enquired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>whither we should first direct our
course in hopes of delivering the Countess?</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Doubtless,” answered my uncle,
“the place most likely to be converted
into her prison must needs be the nearest
fortress belonging to the perfidious
Abbot; no one can doubt, that this
misfortune is a work of his hand.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Here I interrupted him by stating,
that I had heard the Seneschal very positively
contradict this supposition; and
I entreated, that before the expedition
set out, the old domestic might be examined,
as he seemed to possess more
information on the subject, than he had
yet imparted to <i>me</i>. Unfortunately, we
found on enquiry, that shortly after my
uncle’s arrival the Seneschal had expired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of his wounds; and Count Venosta
(who in the violence of his despair preferred
acting upon uncertainties to remaining
entirely idle) immediately entered
upon his search after the unfortunate
Edith. At the end of several
months of fruitless enquiry, we were
obliged to abandon all hopes of success.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was during this period of anxiety,
which seldom permitted my uncle and
Ethelbert to lay aside their armour, that
I received the name of Countess of Carlsheim.
The ceremony was sad and solemn,
prognosticating the days, which
were so soon to follow it.</p>

<p class='c021'>I was now the wife of my lover, and
enjoyed that sort of happiness, which
most women enjoy who marry a warrior-husband;
I was the object of a wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>tempestuous passion, whose expressions
were sometimes so rough and violent,
that they might have been mistaken for
those of hatred. In truth, I had fancied,
that the happiness of marriage was somewhat
different; but alas! what girl does
not fancy the same, and find at length
that she has been deceived?</p>

<p class='c021'>No information could be obtained
respecting the Countess of Mayenfield.
The Abbot of St. Gall persevered in
asserting his claim to her possessions;
and the deep melancholy, which took
possession of my uncle, betrayed but too
plainly, that his love for the dear lost-one
was stronger, than he had dared to acknowledge
either to her, or to himself.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“My children,” said he one day to
me and Ethelbert, “Edith is lost to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and with <i>her</i> the joys of life! It was
folly in me to expect on the brink of the
grave, that I should be so singularly
fortunate, as to feel my eyes closed by
the hand of affection. I have suffered
for that folly; I feel that my powers of
life are hourly growing weaker, feel that
the day of death is at hand. The few
evening hours which remain, before the
night of the grave closes around me,
will I dedicate to solitude and repose.
All that I possess is now your property;
I only reserve for myself the pleasant
vale of Munster, and the Castle of Upper
Halbstein on the banks of the Rhine. I
will hide myself in the distant shades of
the <i>first</i>, when opprest by serious melancholy
thoughts, and repair to the
<i>second</i>, whenever more lively moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>make me wish for the society and comfort
of Ethelbert and his beloved
Urania.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I opposed this determination of Count
Leopold; but my husband did not second
me. He saw, that this arrangement
was greatly to his advantage; and
I had already found on several occasions,
that he was not quite so incapable of
attention to his own interest, as I had
formerly supposed. It by no means
occurred to him, that Count Venosta
proposed to do too much for us; on
the contrary, he lost no time in giving
solidity to my uncle’s kind declarations,
and only appeared to lament, that the
deed of gift had not included his whole
property. The waving shades of the
vale of Munster and the proud castle on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the Rhine seemed to have acquired
double charms in his eyes, since Leopold
declared his intention of retaining them
for himself; and their value was increased
beyond bounds on Ethelbert’s
being given to understand, that my
uncle did not intend to leave them to
us even at his death, but destined them
for a bequest to that beloved woman,
whom he could not resolve to give up
all hopes of recovering.</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Venosta (that honest open-hearted
man, who withheld no sentiment
from those, whom he looked on as
his children) was amusing himself one
day with the youthful Minna, whom the
recollection of her mother rendered inexpressibly
dear to him. Ethelbert
remarked, as if by accident, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>child already had acquired the sedate
appearance of the station, which she was
hereafter to occupy.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“What station?” asked my uncle
with surprise.</p>

<p class='c021'>Minna, who had been accustomed to
hear her future lot pronounced by my
husband almost daily, answered with
her accustomed candour—“What other
shelter can a poor orphan expect to find,
except a cloister?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“What?” exclaimed Count Leopold,
while he prest her still closer to his
bosom, “you poor? you an orphan,
while Venosta lives? No, no, my child;
I know too well, what I owe to the
memory of your excellent mother! Let
who will forsake you, never shall you be
forsaken by me!”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Count Ethelbert had never been partial
to the Damsel of Mayenfield; from
that day he began to hate her.</p>

<p class='c021'>Minna too on <i>her</i> side seemed to harbour
towards my husband a secret aversion;
whose expressions she would have
been unable to restrain, had he not also
inspired her with sentiments of the most
unbounded terror.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Ah! dear Countess!” she said
to me one day, when she found me
weeping at having made new discoveries
of his evil dispositions, discoveries which
almost every day afforded; “you know
not yet, what a bad, bad man he is!
Scarcely do I dare to tell it you; but that
voice which I heard among my mother’s
ravishers.... I am certain, <i>quite</i> certain,
that voice was Count Ethelbert’s—I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span><i>then</i> never heard it speak but so gently
and so kindly.... But the first time
that I heard him rage, I recollected it
that instant. How could I have been
deceived? Oh! I remember too well
the terrible sound! But I have been
silent till now, for I tremble when I but
think of the cruel manner, in which he
used me, when (while imploring him to
take pity on my mother) I let fall, that I
was sure of having heard his voice
before.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I was now better acquainted with the
character of the man, whom I had once
looked upon as an angel of light; and I
recollected several hints of the old Seneschal,
which seemed to imply a suspicion
similar to that of Minna. Yet the fact
appeared to me in a light too dreadful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>admit of my giving it implicit confidence;
and I judged it prudent to contradict
it with my lips, though in my
heart I could not help dreading, that the
accusation was but too well-grounded.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alas! it was not long, before I was
thoroughly convinced, that my husband
was capable of many a deed, of which
during the happy days of my love-sick
delusion I would have asserted his innocence
with an oath, and have suffered
the weight of his guilt to have been
charged upon my own conscience!
Alas! it was not long, before I had but
too much reason to confess, that there
was no impossibility in his having been
concerned in that perfidious act, which
his innocent accuser had alleged against
him.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>The persons, who had been the original
means of bringing me acquainted
with the Count of Carlsheim (an acquaintance
which I already began to
consider as a misfortune), the Abbot
and Prior of Cloister-Curwald had been
maintained in their rights by my good
uncle; and under his powerful protection
they lived in harmony with their
monks from the time of my interference.
However, no sooner had the jurisdiction
of this monastery been made over by
Count Venosta to my husband, than
discontent and rebellion began to resume
their influence over the younger
monks, who felt themselves opprest by
the restraints imposed on them by their
virtuous superiors. Often did Abbot
Christian, when I knelt before him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>his confessional, return my confidence
by an acknowledgment of his secret
sorrows, and explain his melancholy
forebodings of what would be his convent’s
future fate, in a manner that
touched me to the very heart. But I
was myself too weak to assist the venerable
man; my husband was deaf to
my entreaties; and Count Venosta was
at too great a distance to admit of any
good effects being produced by my applying
to him.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was long past midnight, that I once
happened to be sitting alone in my chamber,
expecting my husband’s return from
a carousal at a neighbouring Baron’s; and
I was endeavouring to prepare myself for
the painful scenes, which seldom failed
to follow such entertainments. Suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Gertrude entered the room with a
terrified countenance, and informed me
that having seen from her window which
overlooked the garden some dark-looking
figures, whose appearance was made
still more terrific by the contrast of the
newly-fallen snow, she had descended to
examine what they really were; and
that she had found it necessary to admit
into my anti-chamber the persons, who
had given her so causeless an alarm.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Do not be terrified!” said she,
“they are only poor afflicted spirits,
who hope for relief from your hands.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I was too well acquainted with the
friendly anxiety of my faithful attendant
to spare me pain, and prepare me for
unpleasant news by the manner in which
she related it, to be deceived by her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>assurance, that I had nothing to fear. I
waited for the appearance of these
strangers with a beating heart. What
was my surprise at recognizing the excellent
Abbot of Cloister-Curwald, the
venerable Matthias, and several other of
the most respectable monks, whose
evident consternation already seemed to
implore my assistance, before they yet
had time to give their petition words.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! dear good lady,” exclaimed
the Abbot, “we are undone! the
dreaded storm has burst, and we must all
be the prey of death, unless <i>you</i> can find
means of preserving us! This morning
while officiating at the altar, we were
seized in the name of our liege-lord, the
Count of Carlsheim, and imprisoned in
a subterraneous dungeon. Our appeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to the Bishop of Coira was treated with
derision; and we collected from some
suspicious remarks of our jailor, that
our doom would be finally determined,
long before our appeal could be made to
a superior jurisdiction. Alas! we know
but too well, what <i>can</i> be done in convents!
The fore-warnings of approaching
death presented themselves on all
sides; the noise of revelry resounding
from the chambers above us increased
our anxiety! What had we not to fear
from the rage and malignity of these
intoxicated monks!—Fortunately, one
of my secret friends found means to
gain admittance to our dungeon, and
explain to us the real and pressing
danger of our situation. It seems,
that the enemies of order and of virtue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>are protected by the Count of Carlsheim;
he was himself assisting at the dissolute
entertainment; and probably at this
moment we should no longer have been
numbered among the living, had not
the friend who brought us this intelligence,
secretly assisted us to escape from
the convent, and accompanied us in our
flight. Now then our life is in your
hands; save us, dear lady, either by
softening your husband through your
entreaties, or by pointing out to us
some place of concealment. To you
alone could we have recourse; had we
sought any other refuge, we must surely
have been overtaken before we could
have reached it.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Save you by entreaties?” I exclaimed,
while I hastened to unclose a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>door conducting to my baths; “entreaties
to Count Ethelbert? Instant
flight is your only chance for safety!
Follow me, father! Follow me, and
lose not a moment!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I hastened onwards, and conducted
the trembling monks through a long
subterraneous passage, unknown to all
in the Castle except myself and the
faithful Gertrude. The outlet was in
the mountains; and here I quitted
the fugitives, convinced that they would
easily find their way through the intricate
passes, with which the Prior Matthias
was perfectly well acquainted,
having frequently traversed them in his
botanical pursuits.</p>

<p class='c021'>Half of the night was consumed in
this employment. On my return, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>found the furious Ethelbert waiting for
me in my apartment, and immediately a
tremendous storm of rage burst over
my devoted head. Convinced that my
friends were now in safety, I attempted
not to conceal my share in the transaction;
and when he loaded me with
insults, I replied to him by reminding
him of the promise which he had formerly
given me, to protect the opprest
Abbot in the preservation of his rights,
a promise which he had so shamefully
broken. Truth and justice were on my
side, but power was on that of my adversary.
There was no one to hear me,
and judge between Count Ethelbert and
myself; he was the strongest; the reward
of my remonstrances was the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>unworthy treatment, and my chamber
became my prison.</p>

<p class='c021'>The vassals, who loved me, exclaimed
against such an act of violence, as soon
as they understood by means of Gertrude,
how cruelly I was treated; but
Ethelbert’s art soon succeeded in giving
another colour to the transaction. He
justified his severity by accusing me of
a shameful intrigue with the banished
Abbot of Cloister-Curwald. His assertions
were so positive, that they soon
produced the desired effect; and it was
without any violent agitation, that the
peasants a few days after saw me conducted
away under a strong guard, no
one knew whither; nothing gave me
more pain in this abrupt departure than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>being deprived of the only comfort
which was still left me, the society of my
faithful Gertrude, and of my young
friend, the Damsel of Mayenfield.</p>

<p class='c021'>One man alone, one of the most distinguished
inhabitants of that quarter,
a man who breathed the true spirit of
Helvetic courage, and of love of freedom,
Henric Melthal alone dared openly to
blame the proceedings of my tyrant. He
spread his own noble sentiments around
him, and communicated his feelings to
his companions with a success, which
might have rescued me from my bondage,
had not Count Ethelbert resolved
to withdraw me from public attention
without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the other side of the mountain of
Halsberg, near the lake of Thun, stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>an old Castle belonging to the family of
Ravenstein, a family which has been in
alliance with the Counts of Carlsheim
and Sargans since time immemorial. At
the period of which I am now treating,
it was entirely deserted. The owner resided
in a remote part of Italy, where he
had lived on terms of intimacy with
Ethelbert; and having himself no occasion
for this mouldering castle, he consigned
the use of it to his friend the Count of
Carlsheim; the use to which the Count
applied it, was the only one for which
it now appeared to be adapted, the confinement
of the innocent.</p>

<p class='c021'>Tedious and fearful was the way
which conducted me to my destined
abode; but the place itself, which I
looked upon as my eternal prison, far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>exceeded all the horrors, which had
struck my imagination so forcibly while
approaching it. It was an antient fortress,
perched high on the brow of a
precipice like an eagle’s nest, which now
received the unfortunate Urania. The
peculiar form of its architecture announced
it to have been raised in the
time of Charlemagne; and the incessant
howling of the storm, and raging of the
billows seemed with every moment to
threaten its downfall. I saw it from a
distance seemingly suspended on the
very brink of a steep and barren rock,
which overhung the Lake, and I shuddered,
when my conductors pointed it
out as my future dwelling!</p>

<p class='c021'>Fool that I was! I flew with rapture
into the arms of Ethelbert, where I expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to find an earthly paradise and
was deceived: with agony, keen as that
of the dying, did I enter Ravenstein
Castle ... and was deceived again!
Ah! will short-sighted mortals never
succeed in comprehending, that that
which <i>appears</i>, and that which <i>is</i>, but
rarely coincide? Yet, when we have
experienced these deceptions twice or
thrice, the experience makes us in future
calm and resigned; and we acquire
from it that indifference which raises us
above the frowns and smiles of fortune,
and enables us to repress with equal
strength groundless apprehensions and
unavailing wishes.</p>

<p class='c021'>During the first days of my confinement
I was in truth most wretched.
My situation was rendered almost insupportable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>by the want of every convenience
and comfort, and by the tediousness
of unbroken solitude. I sighed
after society of any kind, even though
it had been such as (to judge from its
outward appearance) would have promised
me but little entertainment.</p>

<p class='c021'>Some days had thus elapsed, when I
observed through the bars of my closely-grated
window, that a boy apparently
between three and four years old, was
sometimes suffered to amuse himself
by playing in the neglected garden,
which I was myself forbidden to visit.
The innocent gaiety of the child made
an impression on me, which frequently
filled my eyes with tears.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Happy unthinking creature!” I
exclaimed, wringing my hands in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>bitterness of grief, “this garden appears
to you a paradise, because you know
none better. You are poor, forsaken,
perhaps menaced by a thousand dangers
which every moment brings nearer;
but you see them not! Regret for the
past troubles you as little as anxiety for
the future; and it were difficult for a
monarch with all his power to make you
more happy, than you are even now!
Oh! that I were like you. Oh! that at
least I could clasp you in my arms, and
learn from your sweet smile the art of
smiling though in prison!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>My wish to become more intimate
with the happy trifler was too ardent
to remain concealed. I entreated my
jailor to gratify me with a nearer sight
of him, and after a few difficulties I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>at length permitted to receive the little
Ludolf in my gloomy chamber.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Ludolf?” I exclaimed, when the
child first told me his name—“Ludolf?”
I repeated still more anxiously, while I
examined his features, and fancied that
I could trace a resemblance, which excited
hopes in my bosom so sweet that
I trembled to indulge them.</p>

<p class='c021'>What then was my emotion, when
the lovely boy convinced me that this
was not the first time of our meeting,
by naming as his mother, “Edith of
Mayenfield!”</p>

<p class='c021'>Yes! this dear, this long-lost friend
was like myself an inmate of this place
of terror! I breathed the same air with
her; I was allowed to hope, that every
succeeding day would afford me an opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of beholding her: the pleasure,
which I felt from these reflections, was
too great to admit of my observing, that
Count Ethelbert’s confining me in the
same place with a captive, whom he had
secured in a manner so treacherous, was
a proof that he designed my imprisonment
to be eternal. Whatever might
have originally been his motives for treating
us with such severity, it was at least
certain, that he would not permit either
to regain her liberty, lest she should discover
the mystery of his inhuman conduct,
or take measures for rescuing from
his power her companion in misfortune.</p>

<p class='c021'>Considerations of this kind did not
at first suggest themselves; I felt nothing
but the joy of being once more united
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to my friend, an event which I now
looked forward to with the most eager
expectation. Heaven knows, it would
have been no trifling comfort to me,
had I met with the most insignificant
of created beings, would but that being
have listened to me with compassion,
and endeavoured to soothe me in the
paroxisms of my despair; but to dare to
hope that Edith would now be my
comforter in this dreary prison, oh!
who can express the countless sources of
satisfaction, which that single thought
contained!</p>

<p class='c021'>But alas! the completion of my hopes
was not so easy as I expected. The
Countess of Mayenfield was confined
not less closely than myself; and our
jailor was not to be prevailed on to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>depart in one single instance from the
instructions of his inhuman lord. Yet
methinks this man was not cruel by
nature. Perhaps, it grieved him to be
compelled to treat us with so much
harshness; but he made it a point of
conscience to adhere in the most punctual
manner to the oath, which (as he
frequently assured me, in answer to my
complaints and reproaches) he had been
compelled to give to the Count of
Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“You see,” said he, “that where ever
it is in my power, I refuse no indulgence.
I received no particular command
respecting the child’s imprisonment,
who was delivered to my custody
at the same time with his mother, and
therefore I allow him to enjoy all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>advantages, from which I am compelled
to debar her and yourself. Neither was
it forbidden me to furnish the Countess
of Mayenfield with such sources of mental
amusement, as might beguile her
solitary hours. She has a variety of
books, has her spinning-wheel and her
embroidery frame; if she chuses it, she
may lay these aside, and employ herself
with her pen; this indulgence, lady,
shall also be granted to <i>you</i>; and methinks,
it must be almost the same
thing, whether what you have to say to
each other is imparted in writing, or in
person.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Here then did our jailor kindly open
a door for those communications, for
which we had so long thirsted; we returned
him our most ardent thanks for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the hint, and lost no time in making use
of it. We wrote to each other daily;
and as the conscientious feelings of this
trusty domestic of my tyrant would
not allow him to deliver our letters
himself, they were confided to the care
of the little Ludolf. The lovely boy
soon became attached to me; he was
ever ready to visit my narrow chamber;
and besides the information which
Edith’s letters contained, I gleaned from
him in conversation many interesting
anecdotes, which however serious their
subject, frequently assumed so whimsical
an appearance through his infantine
mode of relating them, that it was impossible
either for his mother or myself
to refrain from smiling. Heavens! we
smiled! little did our tyrant imagine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>that in the gloomy walls of Ravenstein
Castle his captives would have ever
found cause for mirth!</p>

<p class='c021'>Edith’s letters contained explanations
of many circumstances, which till then
had appeared to me quite unaccountable.
These precious memorials of the most
sacred friendship are still in my possession.
You, my dear children, for whom
I write this narrative of my sufferings,
will find them after my death, as documents
serving to corroborate the veracity
of my statements. Oh! how will
you blush for your ancestor, when you
read that Ethelbert had never been the
character, which we (poor deceived
ones!) believed him to be, and that
from the very beginning his whole conduct
had been an artifice!</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Its true, my person at first was the
object of his desires; but much more so
were the possessions, which I was expected
to inherit. Anxiously did he
seek to bring about our union; but
circumstances, with which Edith herself
was unacquainted, forbade the explanation
of his wishes, and compelled him to
wait, till my uncle should actually force
him to accept my hand. Fear, lest my
expectations of being raised to power
and wealth (on which his own depended)
should be overturned by Count Venosta’s
second marriage, induced him
privately to remove the dreaded Edith.
He had chosen the time for carrying her
off admirably well. A secret understanding
with the Abbot of St. Gall,
(whose enemy he profest to be in public)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>enabled him at once to get rid of Count
Venosta’s vigilance, entice me out of the
fortress, and thus leave Edith totally
without protection. It also afforded
him an opportunity to establish himself
in my uncle’s favour, by rendering him
so essential a service as the restoring him
to liberty; a service, which my too
grateful uncle thought could only be
rewarded by the gift of my hand, without
allowing Ethelbert time to solicit it.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alas! my fortitude fails me, while
endeavouring to unravel the whole web
of artifice and villainy, which our persecutor
had woven to ensnare us with no
less cunning than success. He contrived
to cheat the Abbot of the prisoner, whom
he had first himself betrayed into his
power; Count Venosta of his possessions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>his mistress, and his niece; poor Edith of
her liberty; and me of the happiness and
tranquillity of my whole life!</p>

<p class='c021'>Never had Count Ethelbert felt for
me one spark of real affection. Even
the passion, with which my person had
inspired him, was subordinate to his
desire of becoming master of my large
possessions. No sooner was this point
accomplished, no sooner had the daily
sight of it deprived what little beauty
was mine of the charm of novelty, than
the continual presence of a virtuous
wife appeared to him a check upon his
pleasures. He therefore seized with
eagerness the first opportunity of delivering
himself from my presence; nor
did he forget to sully my reputation by
imputations so disgraceful, that I appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>to the world unworthy of either
relief or pity. Even my good uncle
wept, and resigned me to my fate.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Countess of Mayenfield had
learned the greatest part of the circumstances,
which she related in her letters,
from the wife of the Castellan of Ravenstein;
this good-hearted matron (who
died a few days before my arrival at the
Castle) had a son in Count Ethelbert’s
service, by whom she was informed of
most of his lord’s proceedings. The conversation
of this compassionate woman
had beguiled many of the heavy hours
of Edith’s imprisonment; nor had she
ever neglected an opportunity of evading
the too conscientious adherence of her
husband to his oath, and of furnishing
to the noble captive many alleviations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of her sorrows, all of which vanished
at her death.</p>

<p class='c021'>Oh! had I but found her still in
existence on my arrival at Ravenstein,
what might we not have hoped from
her friendly aid! what would have been
too difficult for three women to accomplish,
of whom the one possessed power,
the second prudence, and the third resolution!
Surely it would have been easy
for us to have obtained our freedom;
at least, I should not have been so long
deprived of the happiness of clasping my
faithful Edith to my bosom.</p>

<p class='c021'>Often in our epistolary conversations
did we lament over the great loss, which
we had sustained in being deprived of
this worthy creature! yet the Countess
comforted herself with the pleasure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>knowing, that I was near her and in a
place, where she looked upon me as enjoying
both more happiness and more
safety, than would have been my lot in
the arms of Count Ethelbert.—As for
myself, I wept, and prayed for better
times.</p>

<p class='c021'>And better times arrived! We had
long suspected, that we were not the
only unfortunates confined at Ravenstein;
and in the truth of this suspicion
we now were fully confirmed, though
our curiosity was by no means fully
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Castle, as I before stated, was built
on the summit of a lofty rock, whose
point appeared designed as a mark for the
assaults of all the four winds of heaven.
Storms here were frequent and tremendous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>In the middle of a tempestuous
night, when the whirlwind was raging
with its greatest violence, suddenly a
remote wing of the Castle burst into
flames! the wind set towards our quarter;
the sparks flew in at our grated
windows; our danger increased with
every moment, and every human being
seemed to have totally forgotten us. No
one had consideration enough to unlock
our dungeons; no one showed the slightest
disposition to come to our assistance.
The general attention was directed towards
the eastern wing of the fortress,
which was entirely in flames.</p>

<p class='c021'>Our terror is not to be described;
yet certainly mine was far inferior to
that of Edith, who had not to fear
for herself alone. The preservation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>a life, which was infinitely dearer to her
than her own, occupied all her thoughts;
she trembled for the life of her son!</p>

<p class='c021'>She was desperate; she felt, that his
destruction was inseparably united with
her own, and resolved to dare every
thing to preserve him. In the wall of
her dungeon was an opening, barely
large enough to suffer the child to pass
through; she fastened her bed cloaths
together; she resolved to let him down
by them to the ground, and charged him,
as soon as he should have reached it, to
release himself and fly, or else to find
some hiding place, where he might remain
till the danger was past. The
risque was dreadful; nothing but despair
could have induced her to adopt
such a resolution.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Edith’s endeavours to preserve her
little darling were not unsuccessful. He
reached the ground in safety; but
scarcely had she parted with him, when
the increasing heat (for by this time the
balconies of the neighbouring buildings
were in flames) and the volumes of
smoke, which poured into her chamber,
overpowered her senses, and she sank
without animation on the floor.</p>

<p class='c021'>My situation was exactly similar. At
the moment when I fainted, the only
thought, which employed my mind, was
the hope of an happy meeting with
Edith in another better world; an hope
which (I fully believed) was accomplished,
when on once more unclosing
my eyes, I found myself breathing pure
air in a light and spacious chamber, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>perceived by my side the friend whom I
loved so tenderly, and for whose sight
I had so long and so anxiously sighed in
vain.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! Edith!”—“Urania! my
Urania!”—we both exclaimed at once,
while we sank into each others’ arms;
“What has happened? are we rescued
from captivity on earth, or released
from the fetters of mortality? Where
is it that we meet, in freedom, in captivity,
or in the life beyond the
grave?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Too soon were our doubts removed:
too soon were we compelled to feel, that
we were rescued from death, but not
restored to liberty. The still smoking
ruins, which met our eyes from afar,
told us but too plainly, that we were still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>within the walls of Ravenstein; and
the unremitting vigilance, with which
we were observed, made us well aware,
that we had reaped no other advantage
from the transactions of the night,
except the delight of seeing and embracing
a long-lost friend. But alas!
what cruel reflections embittered this
delight. Edith sorrowed for her son,
and reproached herself for having suffered
herself to part with him in despair,
when had she detained him with her in
the dungeon, he would have been preserved
as well as his mother.</p>

<p class='c021'>I felt scarcely less sorrow for the loss
of the beloved child, than Edith herself;
I would gladly have comforted her, but
alas! where was comfort to be found?
Even should he have escaped from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>flames, which were raging with such
violence at the moment when he quitted
his mother, how difficult still did his preservation
appear! We failed not on the
day after the fire to examine the place,
whence Edith had caused him to descend.
The opening was not situated
very high in the tower; but close to the
place, where he must have reached
the ground, there yawned a tremendous
precipice; the depth of which when we
vainly endeavoured to measure with our
eyes, the flesh crept upon our bones,
and cold drops of terror chased each
other down our foreheads.</p>

<p class='c021'>Bitter was our grief, but no one
heeded our lamentations; our guards
attended to nothing but the adventures
of the past night, and we collected from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>their discourse, that the fire had been
kindled by a lady confined in the eastern
wing of the Castle. Her object, as they
supposed, was to find some means of
escaping during the confusion, which
her rash action had necessarily produced;
she had not only failed in her design,
but had suffered so severely by springing
from a lofty window, and by the wounds
which she had received from the fragments
of a falling tower, that she was
not expected to outlive the night.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Castellan too, in his endeavours
to prevent the escape of this prisoner
(whose confinement seemed to be a
greater object of anxiety to him,
even than that of Edith and myself)
had met with a fatal accident, and was
every moment expected to breathe his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>last. We desired to see him before his
death. With a feeble voice he entreated
our pardon for the injustice, with which
he had been compelled to treat us; but
he called Heaven to witness, that the
dreadful oaths which had been exacted
from him, had deprived him of the
power of acting differently. Yet did he
not think it necessary to enjoin our
future jailors to treat us with greater
lenity; and they, being in all probability
fettered by the same oaths with himself,
esteemed it their duty to retain us in a
captivity no less strict than before.</p>

<p class='c021'>All we could obtain from them was,
that we should not again be separated;
and also that we should be permitted to
visit that unfortunate lady, of whose
existence in the Castle we were this day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>informed for the first time; who had
made use of such violent means to obtain
her liberty; and who (as our guards
assured us) was on the point of paying
with her life, for having dared to commit
so desperate an action.</p>

<p class='c021'>Curiosity, hope, the fear of finding
some beloved acquaintance in this
wretched captive, or the desire of giving
some alleviation to the sufferings of an
expiring partner in affliction, which of
these motives induced us to make this
melancholy visit, I cannot pretend to
decide. When we received the permission
to enter her dungeon, we were
assured, that we should find nothing that
would diminish our own distress, and
the event justified the assurance.</p>

<p class='c021'>They conducted us to a wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>pallet, on which lay a female, whose features
were totally unknown to us, but
whose appearance excited in us the
deepest sentiments of pity; of that painful
pity, which knows itself unable to
afford relief! On hearing our footsteps
she raised with difficulty her half-closed
eyes, and with a smile of anguish extended
her hand towards us. We exerted
ourselves to afford her every little
alleviation of pain, which our narrow
means could furnish; and in executing
these mournful services, our tears sufficiently
declared the feelings of our
hearts.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Forgive me!” said she, when
after two or three hours our endeavours
to relieve her had produced some little
effect; “I wished to rescue myself from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>captivity, and had nearly brought the
same fate on you, under which I am
now groaning. But long suffering is
the mother of despair!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Shortly after she seemed to be nearly
delirious; she counted the years which
she had already past in this dreary dungeon,
and those during which she
expected to be detained in it by her
tyrant; then she raved about her son,
for whose arrival she had so long waited
in vain, and she entreated him to hasten
to the rescue of his unfortunate
mother!</p>

<p class='c021'>Towards midnight she declared, that
all pain had entirely left her. With an
appearance of gaiety she thanked us for
our attentions, and entreated to know
the names of those, to whom she was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>much indebted. The Countess revealed
herself, and the captive in return bestowed
upon her a look of interest and
compassion.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Edith of Mayenfield?” repeated
the invalid; “oh! I know your story
well: you too have suffered much; not
so much, its true, as <i>I</i> have suffered, yet
enough to know what it is to incur a
villain’s hatred.—And your name, gentle
lady?” she continued, addressing
herself to me.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“I am Urania of Carlsheim and
Sargans,” was my answer.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Urania of Sargans!” shrieked
the stranger in a dreadful voice, while
she clasped her hands violently together;
“Urania? Ethelbert’s beloved Urania?
Oh, Fortune, this blow was still wanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to make me completely miserable.—Away
from my sight, abandoned
woman! away, and leave me to die!
But with my last breath I swear to be
revenged! Even from my grave will I
shriek to Heaven for vengeance! Tremble,
detested girl; thou shalt not triumph
over my corse unpunished!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I stood like one petrified near the bed
of the sufferer; astonishment and terror
almost deprived me of my senses, and
nothing but the consciousness that she
spoke in the heat of frenzy, could have
preserved me from sinking on the
earth.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Noble lady,” I said as soon as I
could recover myself, at the same time
advancing towards her, and offering to
take her hand; “recollect yourself, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>pity’s sake! I never saw you till now,
and can never have offended you. You
surely cannot have heard me aright. I
am Urania, the unfortunate Urania
Venosta, who rejected by a cruel husband,
and undeservedly branded with
shame, have been condemned in this
Castle to wear eternal fetters, which the
flames of last night in vain attempted to
break.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Ha!” said the stranger in a
gentler tone, “is it so?—Are you then
Ethelbert’s <i>rejected</i> wife?—Unfortunate,
let me clasp thy hand in mine; we
are sisters in calamity.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Already was I advancing to take the
hand which she held out, when Edith
uttered a loud scream, and hastily drew
me back. She had observed the captive’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>countenance change suddenly, and
we now saw, that she grasped a poniard
till then concealed in her bosom. From
that moment the senses of the wretched
stranger were irrecoverably lost. Her
eyes full of rage were constantly directed
towards me; she foamed at the mouth;
she loaded me with execrations, and I
was compelled to retire, that she might
have a chance of regaining some composure.</p>

<p class='c021'>The meaning of this dreadful scene
was to me an absolute enigma. I
lamented the poor wretch’s condition;
though a secret horror, whenever
I recollected her words and manner,
took complete possession of my
soul. In this painful situation did I pass
the night; the morning had scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>dawned, when the Countess of Mayenfield
rejoined me, and informed me that
the unknown lady was no more. Edith
was quite exhausted by the terrible occurrences
of the past night. I enquired,
whether she had made no discoveries,
which might unravel these mysterious
circumstances: but she answered by an
assurance, that it was impossible for her
to give me any light upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c021'>In mournful silence did we follow to
the grave the corse of our wretched
partner in captivity. She was interred
in one of the back-courts of our prison;
and we were conducted after the burial
into a gloomy apartment in a quarter of
the Castle, which had escaped the violence
of the flames. Our present dungeon
was in no respect better, than our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>former had been; and the small portion
of freedom, which we had enjoyed
during the few last days, now appeared
to our stern jailors too great an indulgence,
and we were accordingly deprived
of it.</p>

<p class='c021'>We heard the door barred on the
outside; we sank into each other’s arms,
and wept bitterly: then we rejoiced,
that at least we had been suffered to
remain together, and then we wept
again. We endeavoured to escape from
present miseries by recalling former happiness,
and indulging future hopes; but
alas! this resource was but of little
avail. Yet among all the agonizing
reflections which tormented us, nothing
was so painful to remember, as the loss
of our little darling, Ludolf!</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>I will not pain your gentle hearts, my
children, by dwelling on our sufferings
in this forlorn situation, during which
our only support was the soothing of
mutual pity. A change at length took
place in it, but we had little reason to
expect, that it would turn out to our
advantage! Our guards informed us
one day, that the Count of Carlsheim
had sent a new Castellan to superintend
the government of this half-ruined fortress;
and they added, we should soon
find cause to regret under our new
overseer that treatment, which we had
complained of as being so harsh and
rigid. We trembled, as we listened to
this prophecy. Aversion and spite
against this new instrument of Count
Ethelbert’s vengeance were plainly exprest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>in every feature of our former
jailors, yet did they scarcely dare to
express their dislike of him aloud: what
then had <i>we</i> to expect? How dreadful
must that man be, who could strike
terror even into the flinty hearts of
these barbarians!</p>

<p class='c021'>We had not long been informed of
his arrival, when this dreaded Castellan
entered our dungeon, accompanied by
several of our former guards. We
trembled, as we gazed on the gloomy
brow of the man, to whose hands our
fate was consigned. Walter Forest, for
(so was our jailor called) scarcely deigned
to honour us with a look, while he
informed us, that we must prepare ourselves
to quit Ravenstein at midnight,
the Count of Carlsheim not thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the Castle safe enough, since the late fire,
for the confinement of prisoners of our
consequence. We wished to address a
few words to him, imploring better
treatment for the future; but he turned
away from us rudely, blamed the attendants
for having suffered us to remain
unfettered, and having caused heavy
shackles to be brought immediately, he
saw them rivetted before he left the
dungeon.</p>

<p class='c021'>The doors were fastened after him
more cautiously, if possible, than before.
Yet in spite of his vigilance and positive
commands, the former chief of our
guards (who seemed to look on his
being deprived of his cruel office as an
insult) contrived to gain admission to
us privately, and to confirm by his warnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the dreadful suspicions, with which
our imaginations were but too strongly
imprest already.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“I advise you by every means in
your power,” said he, “to avoid committing
yourselves to the power of this
intruder: depend upon it, this removal
to a different place of confinement is
only a pretence to persuade you to follow
him without trouble; and I doubt not,
he intends to convey you to some solitary
spot, and put an end at once to
your captivity and your lives. But
take my counsel, and you shall be rescued
from this danger: Walter is accompanied
but by few attendants, and those
badly armed; our people are treble the
number of his, and we can easily overpower
him, if you will but give us the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>command. Call to us for assistance;
we will all be on your side; and as we
have carefully avoided asking to see our
master’s orders for giving you into
Walter’s custody, we can easily make it
believed that we took him for an impostor,
and thus shall we escape Count
Ethelbert’s vengeance, if you will but
engage not to betray our secret!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>The fellow, who hitherto had seldom
deigned to hold a parley with us, said
much more to the same effect. He left
us undecided, what we ought to think of
this proposal, and what mode of conduct
it would be most prudent for us to
pursue: yet after mature deliberation,
and having completely canvassed the
business by ourselves, the consideration,
that in a situation so desolate as ours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>any change must be for the better,
made us resolve to submit quietly
Ethelbert’s lately-issued commands.—New
situations might furnish new resources,
perhaps even an opportunity for
flight; at all events our present condition
was so hopeless, that we could not
wish it to continue; and when at midnight
Walter Forest unbarred our dungeon
door, we followed him without a
murmur.</p>

<p class='c021'>In all probability the enemies of our
new comptroller had agreed, that our
resistance should be the signal for falling
upon him. We found our anti-chamber
filled with them; all were armed, and
the threatening looks, which they threw
on our conductor, sufficiently declared
their purpose.—But when they saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>that we accompanied him willingly, their
courage appeared to fail them. Some
few indeed unsheathed their swords,
and made a faint show of resistance;
but Walter’s people were neither cowards
nor ignorant of the use of arms,
and we were soon permitted to quit the
Castle unimpeded.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Tremble!” we heard Walter
exclaim, as we crost the threshold,
“tremble, rebels, when I return! You
shall not have opposed our master’s will
without reward, and you shall find, that
I am able to preserve the office, which
Count Ethelbert has thought fit to intrust
to my care!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>At the entrance of the steep and narrow
path, by which we descended the
rock on whose brow the fortress was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>situated, stood a close litter, to which we
were conducted. We entered it; the carriage
moved on with rapidity; and now
it was, that I ventured to discover to my
friend my astonishment, at a circumstance
which had just occurred. In
quitting the Castle one of Walter’s people
had raised the visor of his casque
for a moment, and had shewn me what
seemed to be the countenance of Henric
Melthal! My narrative had already
made Edith acquainted with the character
of this man. In the whole circle
of the ten jurisdictions there existed not
a heart more honest or more brave. He
had been one of my uncle’s most faithful
vassals; and even when that domain
where he resided was made over to the
Count of Carlsheim, Henric still remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>most tenderly attached to the
interests of Count Venosta and his unhappy
niece.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Henric Melthal?” exclaimed the
Countess; “Oh! Urania, if this honest
man is among our attendants, we are
already more than half at liberty.—He
surely knows not the prisoners whom
he is guarding, and doubtless if we can
but find an opportunity of discovering
to him our names and danger, he will
omit no endeavour to free us from our
chains.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>To confirm her in these pleasing hopes
I was on the point of informing her,
that when I was forcibly removed from
the Castle of Sargans, this very Henric
was the only person who dared to assert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>my innocence; when Walter Forest
rode up to the side of the litter.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Noble ladies,” said he, while the
moon showed us, that the gloom, which
had overspread his countenance, was
replaced by the smile of benevolence,
and while the tone in which he addrest
us was the most gentle and respectful,
“Fear nothing; you are safe, and here
is the person, whom you have to thank
for your rescue.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I will not attempt to describe our
feelings at hearing these words, which
were no sooner spoken, than Walter
again withdrew. The litter was dark;
we could not see the person who entered
it; but how were our doubts converted
into rapture, when Edith felt her neck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>encircled by two little arms, and heard
herself called by the name of mother!</p>

<p class='c021'>With one voice we both pronounced
the name of the dear lost child, who
was now restored to us so unexpectedly.
Rapture almost deprived the Countess
of speech and recollection; and I was
myself too much bewildered with the
joy of having recovered the little Ludolf
and my own liberty at the same time,
to be capable of affording my friend
much assistance. As soon as we could
recollect ourselves, we endeavoured to
call Walter to the side of the litter, in
order that he might explain these mysterious
transactions; but he paid no
attention to us. This was not a fit time
for explanations and expressions of gratitude.
Not a moment was to be lost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and we traversed the valley with the
rapidity of the tempest. Till we were
safe on the other side of the mountains,
or had crost the lake of Thun, we were
desired not to expect our curiosity to be
fully gratified; in the mean while we
were obliged to content ourselves with
such circumstances, as we could collect
from Ludolf’s unconnected account,
which however left us no doubt, that we
were indebted for our rescue to the
courage and address of Walter Forest.</p>

<p class='c021'>Providence had made use of Edith’s
desperate resolution of dropping her
little darling from the prison-window,
to effect our deliverance. You see in
this an example, my children, what insignificant
trifles furnish the Omnipotent
Ruler of all things with the means of
blessing his creatures! Our imprudences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>nay even our very faults are not
without their use in the great chain of
accidents; and managed by a hand of
superior power they often produce consequences
totally different from those,
which might naturally have been expected
to follow!</p>

<p class='c021'>In that night of terror Ludolf’s better
angel had guided him safely through a
dangerous path on every side beset with
steep precipices and vast tremendous
chasms. Weeping and exhausted with
fatigue, he was found at the foot of a
rock by a peasant from the vale of Frutiger.
On being informed that he had
just made his escape from the burning
Castle, and was unwilling to return thither,
the honest countryman conducted
him to the house of Walter Forest, one
of the most distinguished inhabitants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>those parts. He received the child with
that hospitable kindness, which no true
Helvetian ever refuses to the unfortunate.
Walter was <i>indeed</i> a true Helvetian;
and he felt double pleasure in
giving protection to a child like Ludolf,
who to the beauty of a cherub united
the most unprotected helplessness:
surely there is no chain more powerful
to bind a noble heart.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was long, before his new guardian
could comprehend the meaning of the
child’s broken narrative; but the names
of his mother and myself (both of
whom Ludolf supposed to have perished
in the conflagration) and his calling
himself the Count of Mayenfield, roused
Walter’s attention sufficiently to induce
him to enquire farther into the business;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and those enquiries at length made him
master of the whole truth.</p>

<p class='c021'>The virtuous inhabitants of that tranquil
valley troubled themselves but
little about what past in the rock-founded
Castles of the neighbouring lords. They
looked upon them as the abodes of vice
and of injustice, loathed their possessors
for the one, and feared them for the
other. Their power was too weak to
permit their preventing the commission
of those crimes, which frequently took
place in these fortresses, though the
report of such deeds of horror occasionally
reached them; therefore their most
earnest wish, respecting these dens of
robbers, was to escape the notice of their
owners, who might otherwise have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>tempted to make them also experience
the weight of their oppression.</p>

<p class='c021'>But Walter Forest (a man, whose
sentiments and actions were in every
respect far superior to those of his co-temporaries)
needed only to be informed,
that two unhappy women stood in need
of his protection, to make him resolve
on granting it. By making enquiries
cautiously and discreetly among the
household of the Count of Carlsheim,
he ascertained the truth of what he had
collected from the child’s narration, and
also that the captives of whom he spoke
had been rescued from the flames. His
resolution was immediately adopted,
and swift and successful was the execution
of his design.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Henric Melthal was an old acquaintance
and friend of Walter; and it was
to him, that the latter applied for information
respecting the history of Edith
and myself. That faithful vassal of
Count Venosta had long lamented in
secret the fate of his former mistress,
and anxiously wished to discover the
place of her confinement. Readily
therefore did he enter into Walter’s plan
for my deliverance; and in the mean
while (through fear of losing time) he
dispatched his son in all haste to give
my uncle information of every thing
that had taken place.</p>

<p class='c021'>The measures adopted for our rescue
by these two honest Helvetians is easy to
be guest from what has been already
related. Henric brought with him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>small band of faithful friends from the
neighbourhood of Sargans, which Walter
strengthened with some of the bravest
inhabitants of the vale of Frutiger.
They were daring enough to present
themselves at Ravenstein, as Envoys
from the Count of Carlsheim; and the
very rashness of the design made it pass
without suspicion. The firm and commanding
tone, which they assumed,
overawed the numerous soldiers of
Ravenstein; our friends were well
aware, that their artifice could not
remain long undiscovered, and therefore
they lost not a moment in endeavouring
to reap the fruits of it; they
were successful, and the captives were
once more free!</p>

<p class='c021'>Edith! Ludolf! dear partners in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>affliction, ye were restored with me to
liberty!—Walter! Henric! our benevolent
deliverers, what thanks could
suffice to reward your services!—But
the generous men expected neither
rewards nor thanks. What they had
done appeared to them an act so simple,
that they rather supposed, we should
complain that our rescue had been delayed
so long; and they thought it
necessary to assure us a thousand times,
that ignorance of our situation and
want of power to assist us had unavoidably
prevented their coming sooner
to break our chains; excuses, which we
(only awake to sentiments of gratitude
and joy) thought perfectly unsuited to
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c021'>These excellent men, who had bravely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>hazarded their lives in a manner so
perfectly disinterested, belonged to the
inferior class of people; they were the
sons of labour, and strangers to the
refinements of wealth and grandeur.
Yet does there really exist an <i>inferior</i>
class among a people, who inhale with
every breath of air the spirit of
generosity and the love of freedom?
Oh! rocks of Helvetia, ’tis
only among <i>you</i>, that we find that
mixture of magnanimity of soul and
unaffected simplicity, which attracts to
your children so large a portion of our
admiration and our love at once!</p>

<p class='c021'>Prevented by distance and by the
increasing infirmities of age, Count
Venosta had not yet completed his preparations
for attempting our rescue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>when we threw ourselves at his feet.
Arnold Melthal (Henric’s son, whom his
father had dispatched with the account
of our situation) had assured him, that
it was unnecessary for him to collect his
forces, since we should certainly be
delivered without their assistance; but
when those we love are concerned,
who ever believes, that too many precautions
can be taken? The news, that
Edith still lived, and that his niece was
innocent, had agitated the venerable
warrior’s mind so violently, that had he
been master of it, he would have summoned
the whole world to our assistance.</p>

<p class='c021'>The small estate, which Count Leopold
had alone reserved for himself out
of all the wide-extended possessions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>which his generosity had bestowed on
my ungrateful husband, was in a perfect
uproar, and his few vassals were already
in arms. As our arrival made these
preparations unnecessary for our rescue,
it was determined that they should be
employed for our revenge. As for
Edith and myself, we entreated that
peace might be preserved; we implored
my uncle to recollect the great superiority
of strength and riches, which our
foes possest: but how difficult is it to
prevail on an antient warrior to lay
aside the sword long accustomed to
victory!</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! Edith,” he replied to our
supplications, “spare me these entreaties;
the unmanly conduct of your
tyrant is too base to be permitted to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>unpunished. Reflect, of how many
happy years the monster has deprived
us, which we might have passed together
in peace and joy; reflect too, that
he robbed you, my innocent Urania, of
your good name, and by that means of
the assistance of your best, your only
friend. Fool that I was, how could I
have been so credulous as to believe his
calumny! How artfully did he long
contrive to keep me ignorant of his
separation from you! and when at
length the remonstrances of Henric
Melthal, and the cries of your faithful
Gertrude, penetrated to my solitude,
how skilfully did he lull to rest my love
and my anxiety by slanderous tales, to
which your uncle (under whose eye you
had so long past a life of the purest innocence)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>ought never to have given
credit?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Such being his feelings, it was impossible
for our entreaties to make any
impression on Count Venosta. He was
positively determined to punish the
Count of Carlsheim, not only for the
crimes which he had committed, but
for the error which (through him) he
had himself been induced to commit.
For this purpose he conducted us to the
strong Castle of Upper Halbstein, on
the banks of the Rhine, which was situated
not far from the scene of action,
and consequently was then more convenient
for our abode than the distant
vale of Munster.</p>

<p class='c021'>Scarcely had we reached the Castle,
when we received a pleasure totally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>unexpected, but long most anxiously
desired. In vain had we endeavoured
to discover, what was become of the
youthful Minna of Mayenfield, whom I
had been compelled to leave behind in
Count Ethelbert’s power. My uncle
assured us, that no sooner had he been
informed of my departure from the
Castle of Sargans, than in hopes of
gaining some consolation for my loss,
he had requested the Count of Carlsheim
to entrust her to his care. His application
however had been unsuccessful;
and the only intelligence which he could
gain respecting her was, that on the
day after my forcible departure from
Sargans, Gertrude had found means to
quit the Castle privately, and had been
accompanied in her flight by the Damsel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>of Mayenfield. Yet when Gertrude
made her appearance at Count Venosta’s
to prevail on him to attempt my deliverance,
and was questioned respecting
the above report, she denied any knowledge
of the place of Minna’s concealment.
The mystery was now dissolved;
on the day after our arrival at the Castle
on the Rhine, I had the pleasure of being
welcomed by my faithful Gertrude!</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! my dear ladies!” she exclaimed,
while she threw herself at our
feet, and prest an hand of each alternately
to her lips, “how much have I
felt for your misfortunes! how much
trouble has it cost me to preserve for
you that treasure, which I am now going
to restore! I dared not intrust it to
the custody of the weak and credulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Count Venosta; but under your care
our lovely girl can have nothing to
apprehend.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Scarcely had Gertrude ceased to speak,
when a blooming maiden about sixteen,
whose charms perfectly answered the
expectation of what was promised by
the childhood of Minna of Mayenfield,
rushed into the room, and bedewed with
tears of filial affection the bosom of
the delighted Edith: it was her beloved,
her long-lost daughter. Bewildered
with joy, for some time neither the
mother nor myself could do any thing
but gaze upon and embrace the weeping
Minna; and Gertrude recounted without
being attended to, why she had so
obstinately denied any knowledge of
her concealment, and had resolved not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to intrust her to the care of my uncle,
who had suffered himself to be so
grossly deluded by the slanders of the
Count of Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was long, before we could recover
ourselves enough to thank the trusty
Gertrude, and listen to the tale of Minna’s
adventures, of which a detailed
account will be found among my papers
(as well as a supplement containing what
afterwards happened to her) under the
title of “<i>Minna of Homburg</i>.” Suffice
it to say in brief, that I had no sooner
been torn from the arms of the afflicted
Minna in order to be conveyed to Ravenstein,
than Gertrude hurried her
away from Sargans, and hastened to
conceal her in the celebrated convent of
Zurich. Their whole wealth in gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>and jewels was scarcely sufficient to pay
for their entrance into this consecrated
retreat, which (as is well known) is
seldom open but to ladies of the highest
rank; and Gertrude’s prudence forbade
her announcing her young charge as a
daughter of the House of Mayenfield.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here they remained under feigned
names quiet and concealed, unknown to,
and even scarcely remarked by their
hostesses the Nuns, till Minna’s expanding
beauty began to excite attention.
The Abbot of St. Gall, and the Bishop
of Coira were more frequent than usual
in their visits to the Domina, and never
suffered an opportunity to escape them
of bestowing a blessing on the lovely
stranger. Gertrude, who had never
been observed to judge the actions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the dignitaries of the church too favourably,
suspected that her pupil was no
longer safe at Zurich, and determined
to change her abode, which she had the
power of doing without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c021'>This excellent woman had been long
courted by a man of no small consequence
in the village of Stein; he was
in every respect deserving of a reciprocal
attachment, and she had long since acknowledged
her consciousness, of his
merit; but still the affection which she
felt for me, with whom she had lived
even from my infancy, was so great, that
she could not prevail on herself to quit
me. After the loss of me and Edith,
when the young Minna was left entirely
to her care, she was less disposed than
ever to think of altering her situation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>A cloister seemed to her the only proper
retreat for herself and her adopted daughter;
and she contented herself with only
seeing her faithful lover at such few
hours, as she could steal from her attentions
to Minna. Then she confided to
him her grief for our loss, and her anxiety
for the fate of her pupil. He was
her only confident; and now that the
holy walls seemed to afford no longer a
secure retreat, Werner Bernsdorf became
more urgent in his entreaties, that
Gertrude would exchange her abode at
the Convent for an husband’s house.</p>

<p class='c021'>Gertrude at length consented to become
his wife, and accepted the protection,
which he offered for herself and her
lovely charge. She quitted the Convent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>privately; and they had already past a
year in his dwelling at Stein in a manner
which left them nothing to desire, except
that which they now enjoyed, the
embraces of those dear friends whose loss
they had never ceased to lament.</p>

<p class='c021'>No sooner had the intelligence reached
her of our release and arrival at Upper
Halbstein, than Gertrude hastened to
restore Minna to our arms, and give us
an account of the manner, in which she
had preserved this treasure. Her husband,
the worthy Werner Bernsdorf,
accompanied her, and brought with him
a considerable number of his country
neighbours to assist my uncle against
the Count of Carlsheim, whose conduct
had made him the object of universal
detestation.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Here Minna eagerly interrupted Gertrude’s
narrative.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh!” said she, “however good
Werner’s intentions may be, we are
already provided with a much more
powerful ally. You are not aware, dear
mother, that Count Lodowick of Homburg....”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Forgive me, lady,” said Gertrude
smiling, “for having so long
omitted the mention of that favourite
name!”—then turning again to us,
“you must know, my dear mistresses,
that the assistance, which the Count of
Homburg prepares to give you, is given
solely, because one of the persons injured
by Ethelbert is the mother of Minna.
Count Lodowick is my husband’s declared
patron; he saw the Damsel of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Mayenfield in one of his visits at Stein,
and from that moment his heart....”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Have mercy on me, dear Gertrude,”
exclaimed the blushing Minna;
“you punish me too severely for my
imprudence!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Gertrude was silent, but we insisted
on an explanation. We now heard all
the circumstances of an attachment,
which are detailed at length in Minna’s
history, but which I could not relate in
this place without breaking the thread
of my narrative, which I shall now
pursue without interruption.</p>

<p class='c021'>The arrival of the forces of the Count
of Homburg and of Werner Bernsdorf
was highly acceptable to Count Venosta.
A variety of circumstances had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>convinced him, that by the gift of his
estates to Ethelbert he had purchased a
dangerous enemy, too powerful for him
to subdue without assistance. Long
was the contest doubtful; but the vengeance
of Heaven at length was made
manifest, and the balance inclined towards
the rightful cause.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert was now reduced to solicit
an accommodation. He enquired, what
satisfaction for the injuries, which I had
suffered, would content Count Leopold;
and he flattered himself, that an acknowledgement
of my innocence, and the
offer of receiving back his repudiated
wife, would cancel all offences: but the
demands of Count Venosta extended
much farther.  He required the restoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of the whole of that property,
which he had made over to Ethelbert
with such imprudent generosity; property,
to which the latter had only a
right in quality of my husband, and to
which he had forfeited his right, when
he ceased to consider me as his wife.
The negotiation continued for some
time; each side abated something in
their respective demands; large sums
were offered to facilitate the conclusion
of the business; but I doubt much, whether
an adjustment involving so many
difficulties on both sides could ever have
been brought, to an amicable termination,
had not fate collected some few
bitter dregs still remaining in the cup
of sorrow, that cup which I could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>have <i>completely</i> emptied, without submitting
to a re-union with my barbarous
husband!</p>

<p class='c021'>Almighty Providence, if ever I have
murmured against thy decisions, if even
now a tear of discontent steals down
my cheek, oh! think on the weakness
of human nature, and pardon mine!
Still, still I suffer!—But doubtless there
will one day come an hour, when time,
or oblivion, the shadows of the grave,
or the brightness of eternal life, will
efface the memory of what I have endured.
Till I can learn forgetfulness, I
can never forbear to sorrow!</p>

<p class='c021'>Not the most distant rumour had
ever led me to believe, that there existed
another Count of Carlsheim besides
Ethelbert. Now all at once the assurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>reached me from all quarters, that
Count Donat of Carlsheim was arrived
from Italy; that after having made many
enquiries respecting Ethelbert’s situation,
(whom he called his father) he had established
himself in the old Fortress of
Ravenstein; and that he was there collecting
a considerable military force,
whose destination was still a profound
secret.</p>

<p class='c021'>We, poor anxious females, trembled
in our solitary Castle, while we listened
to this account of the proceedings of one,
whose very name made us already look
upon him as our enemy. Yet I could
by no means understand, how he should
be the son of Ethelbert, never having
heard, that my husband had been married,
till I gave him my hand, nor that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>he had any natural children, whose existence
(I had no cause to flatter myself)
he would have concealed out of respect
for me!—Edith sighed, when I stated
to her my reasons for disbelieving, that
Ethelbert had a son; and my uncle,
who just at that moment happened to
return from one of his daily skirmishes
with his enemy, explained to me the
cause of her sighing.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Alas, my child,” said he, “it is
not without reason, that you look with
terror on this newly-arrived Count of
Carlsheim. It is but too probable, that
he is Ethelbert’s son, and is come to
strengthen his father’s party. Before
your union with him a report had
reached me, that Count Ethelbert was
already the husband of another, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>his passion for you induced him to conceal
his marriage. This story, making
me look upon him as a seducer, was the
motive of my unexplained antipathy
towards him, and of the displeasure with
which I observed your growing attachment.
I therefore took an opportunity
of questioning him seriously respecting
the report; but no sooner had the first
hint escaped my lips, than his pride took
the alarm.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“To justify myself from such an
accusation,” said he haughtily, “is beneath
me; thus much I will answer,
and no more. Yes; some years ago I
married a noble Italian lady (alas! now
she will never claim her rights!) rich
and beautiful. Before I was deprived
of her, she bore to me a son, whom I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>left to the guardianship of his mother’s
relations; they were anxious to retain
him with them, as being all that remained
of a person so justly dear to them.
The partiality of his mother has made
this boy already master of very large
possessions; nor would his birth at all
interfere with the rights of any future
children, should ever a second wife....
But why do I thus condescend to explain
the circumstances of my private life to
one, who looks on me as a seducer?—You
have suspected me of artfully endeavouring
to ensnare your niece’s
affections for the basest purposes; here
then I solemnly swear in the face of
Heaven that nothing shall ever tempt
me to offer her my hand, or condescend
to seek a connexion with a man, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>has exprest an opinion of me so degrading!
I love Urania, love her passionately;
but never will I become her
husband, unless you solicit me with
your own lips to accept her hand, and
thus wipe off the injurious aspersion,
which you have cast upon the character
of one, whose sentiments are as elevated,
and whose honour is as strict as your
own.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“At hearing this declaration,”
continued my uncle, “I could not restrain
a smile; so impossible did it appear
to me at that time, that a situation
should ever occur, which could induce
me to force the heiress of all my possessions
on the noblest and most powerful
man on earth.—But from that moment
Ethelbert never missed an opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>or working himself into my heart. The
services, which he rendered me, increased
in number so rapidly, and were of such
material consequence; and his countenance
bore so plainly the melancholy
impression of hopeless love, that I could
not avoid wishing to gratify him with
your hand. I now began to make all
possible enquiries respecting his former
marriage. Proof upon proof met me at
every step, that he had acted by me with
candour; I daily received fresh assurances,
that he had indeed been married
to an Italian heiress; but that his wife
was dead, and his son richly provided
for. The last and most essential service
which he rendered me, the delivering
me from the chains of the Abbot of St.
Gall, put the finishing-hand to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>resolution in his favour. I solicited him
to become your husband; cursed be the
hour, in which I did so! Ah! what did
it avail, that Ethelbert’s wife was no
more, since her death only left him at
liberty to contract an union with one,
who has with every hour had fresh cause
to lament the moment, in which that
union was formed?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“And are you then quite certain,”
interrupted his wife (for Edith was now
the Countess Venosta) “that when
Ethelbert became Urania’s husband, his
hand was <i>really</i> free?—Oh! Leopold,
how much have we all reason to lament,
that your own guileless nature should
have made you so unwilling to suspect,
that others were deceivers! that even
when your suspicions were so justly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>excited, your inclination to find them
groundless should have so lightly made
you abandon them, and resume your
good opinion of a man, whose only
talent consisted in concealing his vices
with dexterity!—Alas! alas! even from
the grave thy voice, unfortunate Lucretia,
calls Ethelbert a murderer! Soon
may the curse, which you breathed
against him in your last moments, fall
on the tyrant’s head; but far be its
accomplishment from her, whom your
unjust fury joined with him in the malediction.
Urania is guiltless of your
sufferings; surely had not frenzy and
despair made you deaf to all conviction,
you could not have resisted the arguments,
which I advanced in proof of her
unconscious innocence!”—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Struck dumb with astonishment stood
my uncle and myself, and gazed in
silence on Edith. Her arms were
crossed upon her bosom; her eyes were
raised towards Heaven; the tears
streamed down her cheeks. She replied
not to the anxious enquiries, which her
extraordinary agitation and incoherent
exclamations at length compelled us to
make.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Be patient with me for a few
moments!” said she after some time;
“the dreadful scene, which I witnessed
at Ravenstein Castle, stands before me
exprest in such strong and lively colours,
that horror almost robs me of my
senses! Allow me time to recover
myself, in pity!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>We now remained in anxious expectation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>of the moment, when Edith
should be sufficiently herself to clear up
this mystery. My uncle was totally in
the dark as to her meaning; but certain
obscure suspicions flitted before my
recollection, which Edith’s narrative
soon confirmed. That unfortunate
captive, who had endeavoured to destroy
by fire the gloomy prison, in which she
had groaned away so many wretched
years; she, in whom the bare mention
of my name had produced so violent an
emotion, that it threw her into the delirium,
in which she ended her life; she,
that unhappy one, had a claim to Ethelbert’s
hand prior to that of the betrayed
Urania! In her last moments she called
me the cause of her misfortunes! In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>her last moments she cursed me ...
and I was innocent!</p>

<p class='c021'>Edith’s tenderness had induced her
to conceal from me the dreadful scene
which she had witnessed, and in which
Lucretia had made known to her this
important secret.  She was well acquainted
with the weakness of my
nature; she thought, that for an heart
so tender and so fond as mine, to remain
ignorant of the <i>whole</i> extent of the
misfortunes, which had been the consequence
of my so earnestly desired
marriage would be more supportable,
than to know that I had been the cause
(however innocent) of Lucretia’s sufferings,
and had been myself so grossly
deceived by a man, whom I had once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>loved so passionately, and whom in
spite of all his cruelty I could not yet
bring myself to hate.</p>

<p class='c021'>The veil was now withdrawn! I now
found, that I had for many years been
the unlawful consort of one, who only
deserved my love so long, as I remained
ignorant of his real character. I
now found, that I who would not
willingly have crushed a worm, who
would gladly have banished from the
earth every trace of sorrow, had for
many years caused the sufferings of an
unknown, who perhaps was good and
amiable!—But no! that was not Lucretia’s
character. Of this you will be
convinced, my children, on reading her
story traced by the hand of Edith, and
entitled “<i>Lucretia Malaspina</i>.” You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>will there see, that she had obtained
Ethelbert’s hand by a series of the vilest
artifices; that her conduct afterwards
had been such, as almost justified his
treatment of her; that the son (whose
arrival she so eagerly expected, though
in vain) had been abandoned by her to
early licentiousness, and bred up in
hatred of his father; and her miserable
death was exactly such an end, as was
best adapted to a life so destitute of
virtue.</p>

<p class='c021'>But alas! this knowledge of her want
of merit was still insufficient to support
me under the weight of her dying
malediction. Methinks, undeserved as
it was by me, her curse still hangs over
my head, and sooner or later I shall
experience its effects.—My children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>I must here break off for a few moments—Dreadful
emotions overpower me:
I am unable to proceed!</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c021'>Edith possest still more information
respecting Count Ethelbert’s family.
She knew, that by some means or other
the news of Lucretia’s sufferings had at
length reached her son in Italy; but
sunk in voluptuousness and totally
engrossed by his libertine pursuits, he
had delayed from day to day the hastening
to succour his imprisoned mother.
At length he arrived at Ravenstein, and
demanded the liberty of her, whose
bones were already mouldering among
the ruins of the half-burnt Castle. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>reflection—“<i>hadst thou come sooner, she
had been saved</i>,”—drove him almost frantic,
and in the violence of his despair he
committed the most inhuman outrages.
The whole garrison of the fortress was
sacrificed to the shade of Lucretia; the
remaining towers of the Castle were
converted into her funeral pile, and
were consumed to ashes! He was informed,
that the unfortunate Urania
(whom he, as well as his mother accused
of having caused all these misfortunes)
had once been an inmate of those walls;
and he foamed with rage at not finding
her still there, that he might have sacrificed
<i>her</i> also to his hatred and revenge!</p>

<p class='c021'>The inhabitants of the tranquil vale
of Frutiger, to whom I had formerly
been indebted for my rescue, did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>escape without feeling the weight of his
fury. <i>They</i> too suffered for the dilatoriness,
with which he had fulfilled his
duty to an unfortunate mother; a crime,
which he punished in those guiltless
people, but of which he could accuse no
one justly but himself.</p>

<p class='c021'>Every one fled before the raging
Donat, whose cruelties were supported
by a strong army composed of his
Italian vassals. He now was advancing
towards the place of our abode by rapid
marches, though no one yet knew,
against whom in particular his fury
would be directed. We trembled at
his approach, for our feuds with Count
Ethelbert had greatly diminished our
strength, and we were ill-prepared for
encountering troops so fresh and numerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>as those which accompanied
our new enemy. Neither was Ethelbert
without his fears. He imagined with
no small probability, that his son was
coming to demand the blood of his
mother at his hands; and he was himself
already engaged in a contest with
the Count Venosta, whose military
prowess supplied the deficiency of numbers
in his army. Nothing could save
both us and him, but an union of our
forces against the common enemy; and
now it was, that I was compelled to
place myself in a situation, than which
no other could ever have entailed on
me even half such misery.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the anxiety of his heart Count
Ethelbert made proposals, which my
uncle (who had scarcely less cause for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>anxiety) judged it imprudent entirely
to reject. A negotiation was entered
into; an alliance was concluded against
Donat between Ethelbert and Count
Leopold; and the wretched Urania was
the victim sacrificed to their mutual
fears. Almighty Heaven! the man who
had deceived my uncle, imprisoned
Edith, murdered Lucretia, and branded
myself with shame, this man was I
obliged for the second time to call by
the name of husband.—It was in vain,
that I resisted; that I wept, and knelt
at the feet of my uncle. He bade me
remember, that I had for many years
lived with Ethelbert as his wife, and
that should I go to my grave without a
legal claim to that title, it would leave
such a stain upon the family honour, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>all the waters of the Rhine and Danube
could never wash away.—Nor was this
reflection without its weight in my own
balance—to be handed down to posterity
as the licentious votary of pleasure!
“Urania Venosta, the concubine of the
Count of Carlsheim!” was such the description,
by which I must be known in
after ages? As the hateful thought
glanced upon my imagination, I recoiled
with horror; a crimson blush suffused
my cheeks, and the blood as it rushed
through my veins, seemed boiling.—And
yet to prevent this odious image
from being realized, there existed no
possible means except the consenting
to give the most inhuman of men a
second legal claim to torture and insult
me!—Yet still did I resist; and still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>did the dreaded Donat advance towards
us. Count Venosta’s persuasions
became every hour more urgent.
Entreaties, threats, anger, kindness,
were employed alternately to obtain
my unwilling consent.—Edith felt for
me, and aided not her husband; but
she felt too for the dangers of her situation,
and shuddered involuntarily at the
bare mention of Donat’s name. Her
silent terrors affected me to the very
soul: I was not insensible to apprehensions
on my own account: Ethelbert’s
arms at least afforded me a refuse from
disgrace: I yielded, and with my eyes
open doomed myself to a life of wilful
suffering.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yes! I became again the wife of
Ethelbert!—Expect not from me a circumstantial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>account of my first interview
with a man, whose crimes had now
made him as much the object of my
aversion, as he had once been the object
of my love. The news of his approach
made me shrink with terror! I painted
to myself this imperious tyrant in the
most frightful colours, which imagination
could supply; but in the present
instance, as had been the case on many
former ones, I was deceived in my expectations.
It’s true, the scene which I
had to go through was a most painful
one, but very different from that for
which I had prepared myself.</p>

<p class='c021'>Three years, which had elapsed since
I parted from Count Ethelbert, had
produced a change in him, which struck
me with astonishment; he was no longer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>as in former times, either an object
of love, or of terror: his appearance
was capable of exciting, even in the
bosoms of those whom he had injured,
no sentiment but compassion. It seemed,
as if the natural consequences of his
dissolute life had made a much more
wretched creature of himself, than he
had been able to make of the victims of
his tyranny. Edith and myself had lost
that pale and emaciated appearance,
which we brought with us from Ravenstein,
and were fast resuming our natural
bloom and health; while on the contrary
our persecutor seemed to have but just
escaped from the dungeons of that
gloomy Castle. Nor was it only his
body’s strength which had suffered; his
excessive libertinism, the stings of conscience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and his terror of impending
punishment had broken down the fortitude
of his mind completely.</p>

<p class='c021'>No sooner did he enter the room in
which I waited for him, than he threw
himself at my feet, and entreated me in
the most abject manner to pardon what
was past. He also bathed Edith’s feet
with his tears, and stammered out a
long confession of the injuries which he
had done her, and of which she was
already but too well informed.</p>

<p class='c021'>This excessive and unmanly degradation
of himself was neither what we
expected, nor wished from him. My
sensations were equally composed of
contempt and pity, and I could not decide,
which of the two was the more
powerful.  The latter at length prevailed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and I suffered myself to be drawn
by Ethelbert’s entreaties into making a
promise, which I found in the end most
painful to perform!</p>

<p class='c021'>I am not certain, what were my uncle’s
feelings on this occasion: methought
I could read in his eyes a strong expression
of pity for the poor victim, who
was thus sacrificed to the common safety,
and of anger against himself for having
consented to the renewal of a connexion,
whose consequences must needs prove
to be the most bitter sufferings, that
could have been inflicted on his unfortunate
niece. Terror of his two powerful
enemies had compelled him to free
himself from one of them by this sacrifice;
but alas! he had soon to find his
regret at having made this sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>increased by the knowledge, that it had
been made without advantage. It was
only at a distance, that Count Ethelbert
appeared dreadful. Our scanty troops,
under the command of the martial
Leopold (who in spite of his increasing
age was still an hero) were of much
more effective consequence, than all the
thousands who were ranged under
the banners of the powerful Count
of Carlsheim and Sargans; for their
chief was a wretch, infirm both in
body and mind, made fearful of encountering
the wrath of man by his
consciousness of deserving the vengeance
of Heaven, and who (as we had
soon but too much reason to suspect)
was not always in his proper senses.</p>

<p class='c021'>This last was a circumstance, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>had been carefully concealed from all our
family: but I had not resumed the title
of Countess of Carlsheim and Sargans
more than a few days, when I made
some observations respecting my husband’s
conduct, which opened before
me the most terrific prospects for the
future. I never could ascertain, whether
Ethelbert’s incurable disorder owed its
origin to his imagination having been
struck by any one particular circumstance,
for it was seldom prudent, or
indeed possible to speak to him on this
subject; but why should we seek for a
cause, knowing the life which he had
led? Seldom does the hand of licentiousness
fail at length to guide her
votaries to the brink of an abyss, the
very sight of which makes the brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>turn giddy, and scares away reason,
never to resume her seat again!</p>

<p class='c021'>Ethelbert’s profound and fearful melancholy
afflicted him at periodical intervals.
There were times, when he shut
himself up from every one, but more
particularly from me, in order to indulge
himself in solitary sufferings. In one of
these hours of voluntary seclusion I was
induced (not by curiosity, but by my
earnest wish to afford him some relief)
to intrude upon his privacy. All that I
gained by this well-intended interference
was, (besides beholding a sight the most
heart-rending that ever was presented
to the eye of woman) that I drew down
on me in the present moment the whole
storm of my distracted husband’s fury,
and in future was compelled to witness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>those sufferings, which out of a sort of
delicacy for my feelings he had hitherto
been careful to hide from my observation.
His secret being now discovered,
he constrained himself no longer. Till
this unfortunate day I had never seen
the wretched man except in those gloomy
and capricious humours, which occupied
the greater part of his time. I was now
forced to witness his delirious follies,
which sometimes rose to such a pitch of
extravagance, that Edith and myself had
good reason to tremble for our lives.
Often have we been pursued by the frantic
Ethelbert through every chamber of the
Castle, without being able to find a place
secure from his fury, except on the
borders of that ruined well, in which I
had caused my vassals to inter the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>bodies of those, who had fallen by the
swords of Edith’s ravishers.</p>

<p class='c021'>Never did Ethelbert dare to enter the
Court, in which this well was situated.
The moment that he attempted to cross
the threshold, he shrieked out that he
saw bleeding spectres rising out of the
abyss; that Lucretia was among the
number; and that he could hear her
threaten to drag him down with her to
the grave.</p>

<p class='c021'>Tortures of a guilty conscience, who
can paint you in colours sufficiently
strong! Who can endure you without
sinking at last beneath your weight!
The phantoms, which in his disordered
moments terrified the mind of Ethelbert,
presented themselves in a thousand different
forms. Many of them were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>totally unintelligible to me, as I was not
fully instructed in the history of his
past errors; nor was I at all inclined to
inquire further into events, whose consequences
sufficiently assured me, that
their knowledge would afford me no
sources of consolation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Venosta was at this period
compelled to be often absent from the
Castle of Sargans. His renewed connection
with Ethelbert made it incumbent
on him to become the General
of those troops, whom their master’s
infirmity would otherwise have left
without a leader. Such preparations
therefore, as were necessary for our
safety, were made by the sore orders of
my uncle; and alas! every succeeding
day made us feel with an added certainty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>that no precautions could be superfluous.</p>

<p class='c021'>Our dreaded enemy, the fierce and
incensed Donat, was now daily expected
to appear. I knew well his animosity
against myself; and it is not to be wondered
at, that in spite of the consciousness
of my innocence, I shuddered when
I heard of his approach. But my anxiety
was not to be compared with the horror,
which shook Count Ethelbert’s frame,
whenever he heard Donat mentioned.
He no longer recollected, that he was his
own son; he only saw in him Lucretia’s
offspring and avenger; and often when
his bewildered brain pictured him present,
did he fly for shelter to my arms,
and entreat me to save him from Donat’s
imaginary dagger.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>What I endured at this period, is not
to be believed! My friend Edith had
often advised me to quit my frantic husband;
and so excruciating were my
sufferings, that I probably should have
taken her counsel, had not compassion
in the first moments of my re-union
with the wretched man forced from me
the inconsiderate promise, “that I never
would abandon him through life, but
that whatever fate was allotted to him
should be shared by me;” a promise,
which I had confirmed by too solemn an
oath, and on which Ethelbert relied with
too much confidence, to admit of my
departing from it without his consent.</p>

<p class='c021'>Previous to Donat’s approaching so
near the Castle, I had been offered many
opportunities of exchanging my melancholy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>situation for a secure retreat in the
arms of friendship; but I was too strictly
bound by my fatal oath to profit by the
kind offices of my friends. Count Lodowick
of Homburg, the declared admirer
of the young Damsel of Mayenfield,
had been compelled to leave us
for a time, that he might support the
claims of the family of his mistress
against the usurping Abbot of St. Gall.
Fortunately, the sudden death of this
tyrant greatly facilitated the completion
of his views. He now returned to Sargans,
for the purpose of conducting the
young Count Ludolf to Mayenfield, and
seeing him re-instated in his natural
rights.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was thought necessary, that Ludolf
should be accompanied by his mother;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>but she protested, that she could not
consent to leave me exposed to such
dangers, and insisted on my accompanying
her to a place, where I should be in
security. Oh! how gladly would my
heart have embraced her offer! Nor
in truth did Count Ethelbert positively
forbid my leaving him: in his calmer
moments he acknowledged in a tone of
humility, that after his treatment of me
he had no right to detain me contrary
to my inclination; he left it entirely to
myself to decide, whether I would go or
stay; and declared, that he would not oppose
my abandoning him, if after what I
had sworn, I could <i>reconcile it to my own
conscience</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>You may be certain, my dear children,
that having witnessed in my husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the tortures of an accusing conscience, I
had not courage to run the risque of
imposing the slightest burthen upon
my own. I had sworn, and was compelled
to keep my oath: I even renewed
it, engaged once more never to forsake
my husband, and only entreated my
friend, that she would yield to her
daughter’s entreaties not to be separated
from me at a time, when I was so much
in want of consolation. Habit had attached
me so tenderly to the charming
girl, that to have parted with her would
have seemed to me like the stroke of
death; and even Ethelbert felt such
reverence for the angelic innocence
which beamed in her every feature, that
in his unhappy moments I had frequently
found a safe retreat from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>violence in Minna’s arms. Minna too
was resolutely determined to share my
dangers: nor was it affection for <i>me</i>,
which alone made her unwilling to
depart from Sargans. Count Lodowick
was soon to rejoin us for the purpose of
defending our boundaries against the
still encroaching enemy, and I extorted
a confession from Minna, that she was
anxious to continue near him.</p>

<p class='c021'>We separated; I lost my Edith!
Minna remained with me, and with
beating hearts did we look forward to
futurity, whose gloom appeared to increase
with every moment. Will not
my hand fail me, when I attempt to
describe the most cruel blow, which ever
fell upon my heart? Edith was dear
to me; so was her daughter, the gentle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>affectionate Minna; but dearer than
either, oh! dearer a thousand times,
was my uncle, my second father, the
venerable Count Venosta!</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Lodowick’s appearance at the
Castle of Sargans made my uncle’s return
necessary. The young warrior was
desirous of discussing in person with an
hero of such experience in military
affairs, what mode of proceeding would
be most likely to produce advantage to
the cause of those, whose interests were
equally dear to both. Till this business
was settled, the Count of Homburg did
not think it prudent to quit the Castle,
and leave Minna and myself exposed to
the enterprizes of the enemy, under no
better protection than Ethelbert’s. The
venerable Leopold therefore set forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>for the purpose of acquainting his ally
with every thing relating to the present
situation of our affairs, and at the same
time to inspire our drooping spirits by
his presence with hope and consolation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet once more (alas! but once!) did
I clasp my benefactor to my bosom; I
bedewed his furrowed cheeks with tears
of gratitude, and imparted to him my
anxiety for a life so precious! The
next tears, which I shed on his account,
were destined to fall on his grave. He
accompanied Count Lodowick to review
his forces; here he parted with his
youthful friend, and the path which he
traversed on his return to Sargans conducted
him to death. In the deepest
part of the wood assassins were lurking;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>his attendants were few, and their resistance
was soon overpowered. Count
Venosta fell by the hands of villains, as
many a brave man had fallen before him;
and the dreadful news was brought to
the Castle of Sargans by two or three of
his followers, the swiftness of whose
steeds had enabled them to escape from
the massacre.</p>

<p class='c021'>What name shall I give to my feelings,
at receiving this most cruel blow of
fate? Shall I say, that I sorrowed? that
my senses forsook me? that despair took
possession of both my head and heart?—No!
no! all this would but ill describe
what I suffered. The excess of agony
can never be justly exprest; grief like
mine can only be pictured in a veil.</p>

<p class='c021'>I felt only how dear he was to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>how much I had lost in him. These recollections
made me incapable of all
others; and I reflected not, that his
death was the certain pledge to me of
approaching danger, and future sufferings.
Count Donat was no longer more
than two leagues distant from the
Castle. No one doubted, that the hand
which murdered my uncle, was armed
by Donat: how indeed could he sooner
gain possession of his destined victims,
than by depriving them of their most
able protector?—It is true, Count Lodowick
of Homburg ... but his youth,
his inexperience, even his consternation
and sorrow for the loss of his heroic
guide in the paths of glory, all tended to
prevent his being to us of as much assistance,
as he would gladly have been, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>as we too fondly expected that he would
be.</p>

<p class='c021'>I will pass over in silence the days of
anxiety, which followed my uncle’s
death, nor will torture your tender
hearts, my children, by relating how
cruelly I suffered from terror while
looking forward to events, which (dreadful
as my imagination painted them)
you will find, were far exceeded by the
reality!</p>

<p class='c021'>Count Lodowick fought bravely, but
unsuccessfully. His troops were cut to
pieces; their chief was compelled however
reluctantly to find safety in flight.
The most faithful of our vassals under
the command of Henric Melthal still
defended for a while the approaches to
the Castle of Sargans; but they too at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>length were compelled to give way.—And
now there was nothing to prevent
the dreadful victor from seizing the
unfortunates, who trembled at his approach.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the many unpleasant circumstances,
which had followed my re-union
with the wretched Ethelbert, it was not
the least of my griefs, that I was compelled
almost constantly to endure the
presence of a man, whom I had but too
just grounds for abhorring.—This
person, whom I half despised and half
dreaded, was at that time Abbot of
Cloister-Curwald, and by name Guiderius.
Had there been no other reason
for my disliking him, it would have
been sufficient, that it was he, whom the
rebellious monks of that monastery had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>elected their Superior after the expulsion
of my friends Christian and Matthias;
and that he had taken a conspicuous
part against his predecessor, whose dignity
he coveted, and whose blameless
life made his own appear the more disgusting.
Never did I see him approaching
the Castle, in all the state and splendour
of a petty prince, without comparing
his ostentation with the dignified
simplicity of my venerable friend; of
whose fate no intelligence had ever
reached me, after I had procured his
escape by the private passage conducting
to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c021'>But the repugnance towards him,
which these reflections inspired, was
not my only reasons for disliking the
society of Guiderius. He had formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>been Ethelbert’s companion in his profligate
enjoyments; he was now his
confessor and the only confidant of his
secret sins, and in this quality he assumed
a much greater share of authority in
the Castle, than was left to its weak
master and his powerless wife. At first
I occasionally forced myself to throw
aside that timidity, which I had acquired
from so many years of suffering, and endeavoured
to dispossess the hypocrite of
my husband’s favour and of such immoderate
influence: but the attempt was
always attended with so little success,
that I was compelled to abandon it, and
submit patiently to bear the yoke, which
the omnipotent Abbot imposed on all the
Castle’s inmates.</p>

<p class='c021'>Guiderius was young; he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>have been called handsome, had not
every feature betrayed the traces of riot
and licentiousness. When I complained
of his usurped authority, he frequently
assured me, that I was not <i>his</i> captive as
I stated, but much rather was he <i>mine</i>:
but these declarations, which made him
still more hateful to me, were received
and answered with such contempt and
bitterness, that he at length desisted
from making them. Instead of these
insulting liberties, he seemed to adopt a
particularly delicate and humble manner
in all things, in which <i>I</i> was concerned,
and about which I appeared interested.
So that as I now began to feel easy
respecting his professions of too warm
an attachment, and in this moment of
most urgent necessity, when our terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>foe was at our gates, and as every one
had recourse to me for that advice,
which I, poor trembling woman, would
so willingly have asked of others; in
such a situation, helpless and bewildered
as I was, I did nor think it wise to reject
without an hearing the proposition,
which the Abbot of Curwald requested
leave to lay before me, and whose adoption
(he said) would be greatly for my
advantage. It proved to be of a nature
so innocent, that ill as I thought of the
person who proposed it, I could find no
reasonable grounds for its rejection.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“There are few hearts,” said
Guiderius, “so hardened as to resist the
tears which flow from the eyes of women,
or the voice of God when it speaks
from the lips of his servants. I am thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>persuaded, that Count Donat’s
fury would be this moment disarmed,
could he witness the streams of anguish,
which fear of his vengeance forces into
eyes so bright; nor did he once see you
kneeling at his feet, could he resist
raising you, to fall himself at yours. But
you are unconscious of the power which
Heaven confided to you, when he formed
you so lovely; or knowing it, you will
not condescend to make it of use. Well
then! Let us have recourse to some
other means of softening Count Donat.
Permit me to assemble the whole brotherhood
of my convent in the Castle-chapel:
these holy monks shall form
around you with their prayers a wall
more solid than one of brass; as soon
as your dreaded foe approaches, I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>place myself at their head, go forth with
them to meet him, command him in
the name of our patron-saint to lay
aside his blood-thirsty designs, and you
will be astonished to witness the effects
of our interference.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>I consented to his proposal. Guiderius
gave his orders; and it was not
long before <i>the holy monks</i> (no one but
their Abbot could have had the assurance
to call them holy) set forth on their
march with all possible solemnity, and
with every circumstance of pomp, which
might make them appear of the more
consequence in the eyes of him, to whom
their embassy was addrest. They laid
no slight stress upon the merit of this
act of heroism, as they scrupled not to
call their interference; and one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>most learned brethren went so far, as to
compare their conduct with that of the
Roman Deeii, who for the general good
devoted themselves to the infernal gods;
a comparison, which would have extorted
a smile from Minna and myself, had
any thing at that moment of danger been
capable of making us smile.</p>

<p class='c021'>We waited for the return of these
modern Deeii with inexpressible anxiety.
Yet unhappy as we were, and much as
we required all our strength of mind
and body to support <i>ourselves</i>, we were
compelled to exhaust our powers in the
difficult task of preventing Ethelbert
from sinking under his apprehensions of
his foe’s approach, which he dreaded, as
if it had been that of an avenging Deity.</p>

<p class='c021'>During the consultation, which took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>place on the proposition of Guiderius,
we had been necessitated to leave the
wretched sufferer to himself. After the
departure of the monks, we found him
to our great astonishment busied in removing
the stone, which covered the
mouth of that well, which I have already
mentioned as being so terrible to
him in his hours of distraction. A
variety of circumstances, as well as some
broken sentences, which at first escaped
from him, left us no doubt, with what
object he had sought that particular
spot, and what would have been the
event, had we not arrived in time to
rescue him from his own fury.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the situation in which he then
was, it was unsafe for us to suffer him
out of our sight for a moment. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>employed all our powers of persuasion
to his agitated mind; Minna,
whose kind and gentle manner had
great influence over him, at length succeeded
in kindling a faint spark of hope
in his anxious bosom; and he seemed
to derive some comfort from her assurances,
that (even should Count Donat
prove the furious tyrant, which report
described him to be) still it was
impossible for him to have so totally
laid aside all vestiges of humanity, as to
look on his father as on a foe, and punish
him for offences, which it was now beyond
his power to remedy.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“You are right, sweet angel!” said
Ethelbert with a childish vacant smile,
which generally took possession of his
countenance, when he felt himself exhausted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>by any violent breaking out of
his delirium; “you are quite right!
Donat should not revenge his mother’s
death on <i>me</i>; I never hated Lucretia;
no, no; she was my first love. Its true,
I was unfaithful to her; but though
Urania was more beautiful and rich,
that could only have injured Lucretia
for a while. Had but death relieved
me from my second wife, nothing need
have prevented my restoring my first to
liberty, and permitting her to resume
her legal rights! then all would have
been well; then Lucretia and Donat
would have been appeased: fool that I
was! Oh! that I had not suffered Urania
to live!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>The pious Minna shrunk back in horror
at this proof of aggravated wickedness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>which she had undesignedly drawn
from an heart, whose sentiments (I had
so vainly flattered myself) had been
chastened by adversity. Minna dropt
the miscreant’s hand in disgust, while
she cast upon me a look expressive of
the deepest sorrow and compassion; I
could not restrain my feelings, and burst
into a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Nay, weep not!” said the wretched
man, whose senses had quite forsaken
him; “trust me with a dagger for a
few minutes, and neither you nor I shall
have reason any longer to tremble at
the thoughts of Donat’s vengeance!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>This conversation, which became
more painful with every minute that it
lasted, and which was only calculated
to make two unprotected women apprehend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>a nearer danger than Count Donat’s
sword, was interrupted by the return of
two of the monks, who had accompanied
Guiderius. They accosted us with
countenances expressing the greatest
consternation, and gave us to understand,
that the eloquence of their holy
brethren had by no means produced the
desired effect. Count Donat, an avowed
enemy of the church and her servants,
had ordered them all to be made prisoners,
and flight alone had enabled
these two to hasten back to the Castle,
and apply to us for assistance.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“For assistance? assistance from
us?” Minna and myself exclaimed at
the same moment.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Yes, noble ladies, from you!”
answered one of the monks, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>name was Hilderic; “a sign from our
discreet Abbot gave us to understand,
what steps he wished to be taken. He
is certain, that the intercession of the
Damsel of Mayenfield, one tear falling
from her dove-like eyes, one word
spoken in her touching voice, would be
sufficient to preserve us all! Oh! dear
lady, be not deaf to our entreaties! A
mule stands ready at the Castle-gate to
bear you to the camp, and we will accompany
you thither, and protect you
back in safety.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! for the love of Heaven,”
exclaimed my husband eagerly, “go,
Minna, go! Soften my son’s heart
towards his wretched father, and I will
bless you with my latest breath.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Minna shuddered, while she listened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>to Hilderic’s proposal and Ethelbert’s
entreaties: nor did I hear this singular
request without making many objections.
Yet Hilderic’s powers of persuasion,
and the humble supplications of
his companion, the unsuspicious Mark,
began to make us relax in our opposition,
when the Abbot himself made his appearance,
and decided our conduct at
once.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“If it is your intention to preserve
us,” said he, addressing himself to Minna,
“hasten to the camp, ere it is yet
too late! Under our safe-guard you
cannot have any danger to apprehend,
and in the few minutes, which I passed
with him, I took care to make your situation
so well known to Count Donat,
that you need not fear, lest the power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of your charms should produce an effect
on his heart prejudicial to the rights of
your destined husband.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>These assurances Guiderius failed not
to strengthen with a variety of others;
Hilderic also exerted all his eloquence in
support of his superior; and their joint
efforts were so successful, that Minna
was obliged to give a promise to follow
them to the camp.</p>

<p class='c021'>What line of conduct was it now most
proper for me to adopt? My ideas were
too confused, my apprehensions too
painful, to admit of my observing a thousand
contradictions in the Abbot’s statement,
a thousand trifling circumstances
indicating some concealed design, which
could not have failed to strike any indifferent
person.  Besides, as Minna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>had now promised to accompany the
monks, it seemed impossible that I
should suffer her to set out without the
sanction of a female’s presence, and expose
her beauty and innocence to the
perils, which threatened them in Count
Donat’s camp. It was equally impossible
for me to leave my poor weak husband
to himself, and resign him to the
dangerous caprices of his delirium, which
during our absence would most probably
return. Yet my blood ran cold at the
idea of remaining alone in the power of
a desperate man, who had so lately declared
his intentions to destroy me;
intentions, which in his frenzy he would
find but little difficulty in carrying into
effect. Part of our adherents had already
hastened to the camp, in hopes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>avoiding Count Donat’s vengeance by a
voluntary surrender; the rest of them
had either betaken themselves to flight,
or had sought various places of concealment,
till the first storm should have
subsided. After Minna’s departure I
should be left quite alone with the frantic
Ethelbert. I knew not what to resolve,
and yet it was necessary to resolve on
something without delay.</p>

<p class='c021'>At length it was settled, that accompanied
by the fathers Mark and Hilderic
I should set forward with Minna, and
throw myself at the feet of our enemy.
In the mean while the Abbot consented
to watch over my husband’s actions; a
consent, which he seemed to give with evident
reluctance, though the great influence
which he possest over the maniac’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>mind pointed him out as well suited for
the employment.</p>

<p class='c021'>We proceeded slowly, as those are accustomed
to do, whose road conducts
them to certain sorrow. The learned
Hilderic endeavoured to inspire the
trembling Minna with confidence, for
which purpose he vainly exhausted
every argument of consolation, which
religion or philosophy could furnish.
In the mean while, I was busied in trying
to draw such information out of the
simple Mark, as might confirm either
my hopes, or my apprehensions. This
man, both in conduct and inclinations,
was in truth the best among the brotherhood
of Cloister-Curwald; but his perception
was so limited, that the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>might have perished, without his having
the least suspicion of such an event taking
place, or being able to give the least
account of it after it had happened. All
that he could produce to satisfy me, were
repeated assurances, that he believed the
step which we were taking to be right
and prudent; but as to what had past
between Guiderius and Count Donat, or
what reception we might reasonably
expect from the latter, I found that
father Mark was no less ignorant than
myself.</p>

<p class='c021'>We drew near the conqueror’s tent.
My heart beat violently: what was I to
expect from one, who had sworn to
sacrifice me to the manes of his mother!
I endeavoured to muster up all my resolution;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>I threw back my veil, and followed
with desperate courage, whither
the Monks conducted us. Count Donat
stood before me. I threw myself at his
feet, and strove to comprise in one imploring
look all that I wished to ask of
him, but which terror prevented me
from expressing in words.</p>

<p class='c021'>Donat’s piercing eyes dwelt for some
moments on my face in silence. He then
turned to one of the Friars of Curwald
who stood behind him, and asked, “if
this was the person, whose beauty he
had heard him praise so highly?”</p>

<p class='c021'>—“That is Urania Venosta,” answered
the Monk, “Countess of Carlsheim
and Sargans.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Instantly the expression of Donat’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>features changed, and the look of satisfaction,
which they had worn at first, was
replaced by that of aversion. He turned
from me without speaking, and advanced
to receive Minna, who approaching
slowly raised her veil, and sank on
her knees before him with that inexpressible
grace, which accompanied even
the most trifling of her actions.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Mercy! mercy!” she exclaimed,
while she extended towards him her
hands clasped in supplication; “mercy
for the helpless and the innocent! Is
it possible, that the victorious Donat
should stain the glory of his sword, by
directing it against trembling women,
against an infirm father, against a people
who willingly submit themselves to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>his power?—Oh! be that far from
him!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Donat drew back a few steps, and
gazed on her with a look, in which we
endeavoured vainly to read the sentiments
of his bosom. No one could
guess from it, whether he suffered the
fair suppliant to remain kneeling through
forgetfulness of every thing but her
beauty, or from feeling the same contempt
for <i>her</i> entreaties, with which
he had treated mine.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Rise!” said he at length in
a stern voice, but whose sternness
was evidently assumed; “who are
you?”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Minna of Mayenfield.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“And your companion?” he resumed,
pointing to me.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>—“Urania Venosta, my adopted
mother, and the wife of your father,
of your father who shudders at your approach!
Oh! Donat, think how dreadful
it is to be the cause of terror to a
repentant father!—Mercy, Donat! Oh!
mercy for us all!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Donat raised the imploring girl without
replying; he also motioned to me
to quit my kneeling posture, and then
ordered his attendants to conduct us
into another tent.</p>

<p class='c021'>Towards evening he visited us, and
gave that answer in person, which we
had vainly solicited in the morning.
Now that he had laid aside his threatening
casque and blood-stained armour,
he appeared to be entirely a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>person. His manner was respectful to
Minna, courteous to me. He mentioned
his father in terms rather of grief
than anger; Lucretia’s name, (which,
as we had been informed, used to be
constantly on his lips) was not pronounced
by him; and in the course of
conversation he once so far forgot
his wrath, as to mention me by the title
of “his mother.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh! rejoice with me, dear Minna,”
I exclaimed, while I prest the
Damsel of Mayenfield to my bosom;
“it is now certain, that we are safe!
Heard you not, that Count Donat called
me mother? See’st thou in him that
terrific conqueror, such as report described
him? Oh! that Ethelbert were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>but here to know, and love the real character
of his so dreaded son: all would
be pardoned, all forgotten!”</p>

<p class='c021'>—“That is possible,” answered Donat,
who could not help smiling at the
unrestrained expression of my feelings;
“the only person who has anything to
pardon is myself; and I cannot deny
that beauty like Urania’s may well excuse
an act of injustice, even though it
should be monstrous as that, which was
suffered by the poor Lucretia!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>We saw, that at the recollection of
Lucretia a cloud seemed to pass over
Donat’s countenance, though it soon
disappeared again. We therefore lost
no time in mentioning to him the only
request about which we were now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>anxious, fearful lest he should alter his
good dispositions towards us, before
they had produced the effect which was
so earnestly desired.</p>

<p class='c021'>We entreated him to suffer us to
return to his anxious father, and inform
him, how unjustly he had doubted his
son’s filial affection. Donat hesitated,
and inquired, why we were desirous of
leaving him in such haste?—Besides our
wish to relieve Count Ethelbert from his
apprehensions without loss of time, we
alleged as an excuse the impropriety of
our remaining in a camp without any
other females.</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Oh!” replied Donat, “this last
reason can be none for your departure;
and if you have no better, I flatter myself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>that I shall not lose your company,
till after I have been presented by you
to-morrow to my long-estranged father
in the Castle of Sargans. You are not
the only ladies in my camp; I have a wife
and sister with me, who will be delighted
to welcome you, and who (to confess
the truth) pleaded with me in your
behalf most urgently, ere I was yet decided,
what answer I should make to
your request.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>It is impossible to express the various
causes of satisfaction, which we discovered
in these few words. It is no
trifling comfort for bashful timid women
to meet with persons of their own
sex in a place, where they expected to
find only rude turbulent soldiers; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>here we found two benevolent beings,
whose kind hearts had already induced
them even without knowing us to interest
themselves in our behalf. But
that which above all seemed music to
my ear, was the information, that one
of these unknown ladies was Count
Donat’s wife. In the course of our
conversation, our conqueror’s eyes had
frequently dwelt on Minna’s face with
an expression by no means equivocal;
I was strongly inclined to attribute his
unexpected lenity entirely to my companion’s
charms. Minna was the betrothed
of another. Donat was a tyrant.
My heart foreboded from these
circumstances a long succession of difficulties
and dangers; all of which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>banished as phantoms existing only in
my imagination, as soon as I understood,
that Donat was already married, and that
he hesitated not to place the young creature,
whom he looked upon with so
much interest, under the protection of
his wife.</p>

<p class='c021'>We were presented to the ladies, who
composed Count Donat’s family. We
were graciously received: yet we could
not help remarking, that the behaviour
of the young Countess of Carlsheim rather
exprest that condescension which is
only used with inferiors, than the friendly
openness which marked our reception
by Count Donat’s sister, who was made
known to us by the name of Adelaide,
Lady of the Beacon-Tower.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Besides this, it must be confest that
the appearance of the Countess Mellusina
(such was the name of Donat’s
wife) was by no means such, as prejudiced
us in her favour. The best that
could be said of her, was that she was
not ugly; and the haughty manners,
which she thought proper to assume,
were but ill calculated to make her person
appear to advantage.—Oh! how
different was Mellusina from the
interesting Lady of the Beacon-Tower!</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Can this lovely woman,” I said
to Minna, as soon as we were left alone,
“can she be Lucretia’s daughter, and
the sister of Count Donat? I vainly
endeavoured to find in that heavenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>countenance a single feature, which resembled
her nearest relations.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Minna however maintained, that she
could discover a strong likeness to Count
Donat; we at length determined, that
early misfortune had extinguished the
brilliant fire of Lucretia’s eyes, which
(on further reflection I was compelled to
own) had descended to her daughter;
and also that female delicacy prevented
her superior stature and commanding
make (in both of which she was her
brother’s very counterpart) from inspiring
that terrific awe, which at sight of
Count Donat made every beholder’s
heart tremble.</p>

<p class='c021'>The night, which succeeded a day, in
which we had gone through so much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and with success so unexpected, was
past in a state of no trifling anxiety.
Finding ourselves obliged to accept the
invitation prest upon us most earnestly
by Count Donat and the ladies (to remain
with them till the next morning,
when the camp would be raised) we
entreated, that at least a messenger might
be dispatched to assure Ethelbert, that
his fears were without foundation.
Adelaide lost no time in causing Mark
and Hilderic to hasten back to the Castle,
and relieve the Abbot from the difficult
task of watching over the actions of a
man, who was by no means fit to be
trusted with himself; they were also
commissioned to request Guiderius to
return without delay to the camp, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>inform us, in what manner our absence
had affected the unfortunate Count of
Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c021'>Gladly would Adelaide have accompanied
the Friars, and thrown herself at
the feet of her wretched father, whom
she had never seen. Her brother however
did not think proper to permit
her departure; and she now shared in
our uneasiness at perceiving, that one
hour after another stole away without
the arrival of any intelligence from the
Castle.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet great as was my own anxiety, it
was evidently far inferior to Adelaide’s.
Her evident agitation was so excessive,
that I found some difficulty in ascribing
it entirely to the interest, which she felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>about a father, whom she had never
seen, and for whom she had nothing to
fear, since his fate depended on her
brother. She had suddenly left the
tent during supper without taking leave
of us: it was already past midnight;
when, guiding her steps with a dark
lanthorn, we saw her return, under
the pretence of paying us those compliments
of the night, which she had before
omitted, and of talking over with us
undisturbed the circumstances of our
mutual inquietude. But it was clear,
that she had not yet mentioned all her
motives for visiting us at this unusual
hour. Somewhat lay concealed in her
heart, which she longed to reveal; unluckily
she delayed the wished disclosure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>till the opportunity was lost. The
curtain, which closed our tent, was suddenly
withdrawn, and Mellusina entered.</p>

<p class='c021'>While her manner gave us to understand,
that her presence was an honour
which she bestowed on us extremely
against her own inclination, she
entreated permission to share our
nocturnal conference. Adelaide inquired
with her accustomed gentleness,
why her dear sister should think
it necessary to deprive herself of her
night’s repose?</p>

<p class='c021'>—“You have not the same cause
that we have,” said she, “to watch
away the melancholy hours; sleep is
not banished from <i>your</i> eyes, by anxiety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>for the fate of an husband and a father,
and by those foreboding fears of some
misfortune having befallen him, which
the long delay of our messenger must
needs excite.”—</p>

<p class='c021'>—“Whatever may be the reason,”
answered the Countess coldly, “I found
it impossible to sleep. The glimmering
of your lamp attracted me hither, and
I was much surprised ... much
rejoiced, I meant to say, ... at finding
that <i>you</i>, Adelaide, had arrived here
before me!”—</p>

<p class='c021'>Good heavens! how is it possible for
any being possest of common feeling,
to intrude into a circle without any
other object, than disturbing the pleasure
of those who are already assembled!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Mellusina’s situation must have
been as unpleasant to herself, as her
presence was to us. She resisted with
difficulty her inclination to slumber;
and on the other hand, we suffered
under the most torturing impatience to
see her either departing, or asleep. It
was more evident with every moment,
that matters of the utmost importance
floated upon the lips of Adelaide, and
we waited with inexpressible anxiety
for the moment, when she would be at
liberty to disclose them.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus did we mutually torment each
other during more than half the night;
when suddenly we were startled by a
circumstance, at once the most unaccountable
and the most impossible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>me to forget.—It was almost morning.
We were all silent, for we had
long exhausted the few uninteresting
topics, on which we could converse
with Mellusina.</p>

<p class='c021'>Adelaide had already made two or
three movements, as if she would have
taken leave of us, and yet could not
resolve to abandon all hopes of finding
an opportunity of speaking to us unobserved.
The lights burned faintly.
Mellusina’s eyes at length closed; and
to our great delight we saw her head
recline against her shoulder with a look,
which convinced us, that sleep had at
last taken complete possession of her.
Adelaide drew nearer to us, and pressing
her finger on her lip with an air of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>caution, pointed with her other hand
to the sleeping Mellusina.  At that
moment * * * * *</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
